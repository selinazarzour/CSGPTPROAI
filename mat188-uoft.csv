"Quizzes &amp; Lecture Schedule: <p>Hello Teaching Team,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is the &#34;short check-in in the form of a Quercus quiz before each lecture&#34; the same as the &#34;Pre-Class Essential Check-in&#34; in the Lecture Schedule? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Will the full Lecture Schedule ever be released? I would think some of us would like to study ahead, and the full Lecture Schedule would be helpful as we would know the suggestion practice problems from the textbook for the coming weeks. </p>

"Choice of value for the first cell in a line for the tic-tac-toe activity: <p>During the first lecture, we created a system of coordinates to describe the position of a cell in a game of tic-tac-toe. We decided that the top-left cell would be (1, 1) in a two dimensional grid, (1,1,1) in three dimensinons and (1,1,1,1) in four dimensions. Is there a mathematical reason for choosing 1 as the first value? Why did we not choose 0?</p>

"Week 0 lecture reflection unavailable: <p>Dear Profs,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have noticed in the class module: LEC0103/0105 Material there is a link supposedly for lecture reflection. However, it only leads to the welcome page of the course with a notification that the link is no longer available. Would we still be required to complete the post-lecture reflection then? If so, where can we access it? </p>

"Subsets vs. Equality of sets: Today at the end of class we used set notation to show where is reachable using the subway and TTC. Initially we said that the areas reachable were a subset of R^2, but at the end that was changed to be equal to R^2. As I understand R^2  represents all 2d points, and when you set two sets equal to each other then that means that they are both subsets of each other. So, how is R^2 a subset of all the points reachable by the subway and TTC?","<p>I think like this:</p>
<p>Because:</p>
<p>1,each element of the 2D point contains two unknown number(&#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39;),</p>

<p></p>

"Properties of perpendicular vectors: <p>Dear professors of MAT188,</p>

I am working on it now, and am finding it to be very challenging, and am wondering if I simply do not understand the material, or if we haven&#39;t covered it in depth.

I saw someone ask the same question, but I don&#39;t believe it was about the infinite solutions. <br /><br />I&#39;m wondering if I am just completely confused about the question or have a wrong solution, or if we haven&#39;t gotten to this level of sketching yet? I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m getting ahead of myself here.<br /><br />I was hoping someone could give me a hand or perhaps some words of wisdom. <br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />VP","First, Written HW is designed to be more challenging compared to other components of the course. They are designed so that you discuss them with your peers and the teaching team and push your limits. Typically, they will not contain questions that you have seen before. <br /><br />At this point, after some work and discussion, you should be able to do Q1 and 2. you can also explore Q3 and 4 and set up equations for them. You will need your next week&#39;s material to comfortably solve them. <br /><br />Q2: you are on the right track thinking there are infinitely many vectors perpendicular to the given one. To visualize them and draw a sketch, assume they are all in standard positions. Then only think about the tip of the vectors, what geometrical object do they form?

<p>Notice that from the Cartesian equation of the plane (x-2y&#43;3z=0), we can define any variable using the other two variables. Professor Chan chose to define x in terms of y and z, which became x = 2y-3z. Now we can write x = 2y - 3z, y = y, z = z, and we can group the same variables together into two vectors (so the first is &lt;2y, y, 0&gt; and the second is &lt;-3z, 0, z&gt;). If we write the two vectors based on the variable (one only has y, the other only has z), we can factor out the variable (or scalar multiple) and we will be left with two vectors (y* &lt;2, 1, 0&gt;) and (z* &lt;-3, 0, 1&gt;). This defines a plane provided that y and z can be any real number. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Since writing the scalars as y and z can be confusing and unconventional, Professor Chan let y = a and let z = b at the start of the process, so you can imagine any instance of a in his writing is y, and b is z. </p>

<p>I wanted to make sure my understanding of this question is correct. Since the equation of a plane in &#39;A.&#39; has no &#39;z&#39; variable does that mean it has a normal that is horizontal? Therefore explaining the plane&#39;s vertical orientation? I only ask because I want to make sure my thought process is correct and I did not get the right answer accidentally.</p>","I agree with your thought process. You could also graph the equation in R3 and see the orientation of the plane that way. Test which points, when plugged into the equation, would result in a true equation.
That is good thinking. Your thought process went through the orientation of a normal vector and from there you deduced the orientation of the plane. Alternatively, you can try to visualize the plane directly by exploring which points are on it. It is a good exercise to do both. "

I simply drew both lines by inputting values for the parameters t and k, and inputting the vectors given to us in the question for v, w, and u.

For this context you can still treat it like a point on a line.

<p>Gauss Jordan elimination is more so used for a system of linear equations (ie. when you have several). It doesn&#39;t make much sense to apply it to a single linear equation.

PCE week3 introduce: I still can&#39;t get what&#39;s the difference between codomain and range. Thanks for reply.,"<p>The codomain can be thought of as the set of values that a function could theoretically output, and the range the set of values it actually outputs. As an example, consider $$f(x)=x^2$$, then $$f$$ is defined as $$f:R\mapsto R$$ (takes a real number and gives back a real number); the codomain is just the set of all real numbers, but we can constrain that further to just the positive and zero real numbers for the range.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This feels like an arbitrary choice, but there are some reasons for it; namely sometimes it is incredibly difficult to compute the range (say for a 6th degree polynomial) but we still want to say something about the outputs, that&#39;s where the codomain is useful. I think this discussion gives fairly good reasons for why we separate codomain and range: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/777563/codomain-of-a-function</p>
<p>Indeed that is a good explanation. Codomain is just the space we are mapping to, not necessarily excluding the parts of the codomain space that the transformation cannot map to. For example, a 3 by 2 matrix represents a linear transformation where the codomain is R^3. However, because it represents the span of 2 R^3 vectors is only a plane, but not all of R^3.</p>

What image best displays this relationship (i.e., “should the planes be perpendicular?”, “should only two of them be perpendicular?”, “are any of the planes equal?” are the types of questions you should be asking). Note that some might be ambiguous and may require guessing. 
<p>Good question! If you&#39;re still wondering about this, then the first thing I would suggest is trying the lower dimensional 2D case first. How can you determine whether two linear equations in 2 variables have a solution *in terms of their graphs?* That is what we are doing here, but in 3 variables. The idea is the exact same, but you get more interesting behaviour here. </p>

"Matrix Vector Products Confusion: <p>Hi, </p>
<p></p>
<p>From my understanding, when we multiply a matrix by a vector (Ax-&gt;), we&#39;re specifically using the <em>coefficient matrix </em>(not augmented). If so, can we use the linear system and convert them into vector components? </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>","Yes. We can only multiply vectors by coefficient matrices. That’s why they’re called <i>coefficient</i> matrices! But we cannot write the coefficient matrix as a sum of vectors. We can only interpret matrix-vector multiplication to be the equivalent of setting up a linear system. Notice how I said <i>matrix-vector multiplication</i>! A matrix itself is not a linear system. ONLY when it is multiplied by a vector (or if that kind of operation is being assumed, in the case with an augmented matrix). 
Your vector $$\vec x$$ here is indeed $$\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}$$. Try computing $$A\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}$$."

If the first <b>column</b> is 3, 6, 7, then I would  subtract 2x(first row) from the second row. Then, I would multiply the third row by 3, and then subtract 7x(first row) from it. For the third row, you can also just work with fractions however it may be inconvenient for an exam where calculators are not permitted.<div><br /></div><div>Do the same for the second column, except use the entry in the second row to eliminate the rest of the numbers in that column. And so on.</div><div><br /></div><div>To know when there are free variables, just read and understand the rules for what classifies a matrix as being in RREF.

<p>If your issue is arising in part b), there appears to be no real solution using the rotation formula. Regardless of if you try to compose the two transformations using math we have yet to learn in class (as of 29 Sept.) or if you do them one at a time, the equation for transforming $$z$$ to the desired value of $$- \frac {\sqrt {3}} {2}$$ requires complex numbers to solve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is not an issue in and of itself, as complex numbers are quite natural for describing rotations. However, as this course has never touched complex numbers, it seems unlikely that it would require their use for a correct answer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Allowing the matrix to take on arbitrary values produces a solution, but this does not feel like the intended solving path as it no longer holds to the idea of rotating the camera.</p>

"Problem 4b HW2: <p>Hello,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am wondering whether we are permitted to compute the two rotation angles in 4b using a scientific calculator once we derive the first to be arccos(a) &#43; b, or whether we should solve the second angle in terms of arccos(a) &#43; b. Computing the direct angle measure would save a lot of space and computation on the page (unless I am missing a simpler way to derive the second angle once we&#39;ve found the first). I wrote a &#43; b so I don&#39;t write the answer on Piazza. </p>
<p></p>
<p>*I took the advice from another Piazza question and rotated by xy first after seeing z would require complex solutions</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks</p>","<p>yes you can use a calculator on the questions. also yes you can directly use the angle measure and trig ratios as decimals because the question is asking you for the transformations and not the actual angles or the rotation matrix. But be sure to indicate the angle you are using.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is also possible to replace the trigonmetric functions using the identity $$\sin^2(a) + \cos^2(a) = 1$$, rearranging for one of the functions then substituting. This allows you to avoid decimals altogether and use exact value. See @205_f1 for an example of what this looks like. </p>

Every standard matrix corresponds to exactly one linear transformation. Two linear transformations may have the same output for some vectors (ex: reflection w.r.t y-axis and counterclockwise rotation through 180 degrees on $$\vec e_1$$ give the same output) but that doesn&#39;t mean they produce the same output for every input.

"Week 2 PCE: example of using rank function to determine if system has a single solution: <p>In PCE for Week 2 there is a an example on page 7 that reads as follows:</p>

<p></p>
<p>$$\text{Rank}(A)=\text{Rank}(B)=\text{# of rows in $A$}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>That is, we need both equal ranks for the coefficient matrix $$A$$ and the augmented matrix $$B$$, and we also need them to be equal to the number of rows in either matrix, since we need to ensure there are no free variables. Is this logic correct?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Follow up: is there a better notation to indicate row count in a matrix?</p>","This assumes that the A is an n x n matrix whereby the number of variables is the same as the number of variables, but what if you have a matrix that m &lt; n then it is not even possible for the rank A and B = n.

<p>For the system to be consistent, you need the rank of the coefficient and augmented matrix to be the same. So your logic id great here. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For the system to have no free variable you need every COLUMN of the coefficient matrix to be a pivot column. In other words, you need the rank of the coefficient matrix to be equal to the number of its <strong>columns </strong>(and not rows). </p>

"Is the Zero vector parallel to all vectors?: If the definition of parallel vectors is that <b>v </b>= k<b>w </b>where k is a Real Number, then wouldn’t having k = 0 mean that [0,0] = k<b>w, </b>making the zero vector parallel to all vectors? By definition, the zero vector is also orthogonal to all vectors.<div><br /></div><div>If <b>v</b> is parallel to <b>a </b>and<b> a </b>is parallel to <b>w, </b> it follows that <b>v </b>is parallel to <b>w.</b> However, if <b>a</b> = [0,0] and [0,0] is parallel to all vectors, wouldn’t this imply that all vectors are parallel to each other? Obviously this can’t be the case.</div><div><br /></div><div>Is there any restriction on k in the definition of parallel vectors? Would appreciate any clarification.</div>","<p>In Prof. Shai Cohen&#39;s class, he mentioned that the zero vector does not have direction, with the justification that if you set it orthogonal to one vector, $$\overrightarrow a$$, for example, you could then set it parallel to $$\overrightarrow b$$ or something like that, then you could claim $$\overrightarrow a⊥\overrightarrow b$$ although it could be false. The example you provided also makes it clear why the zero vector should not have direction.</p>
<p>Also, he provided a distinction between perpendicular and orthogonal, stating that perpendicular would be dot product = 0 but the vectors involved should not be 0 vectors, but orthogonal vectors have a dot product equal to 0 but can involve zero vectors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, I&#39;m not too sure for parallel lines as the condition is that the vectors should be scalar multiples, where internet sources point out that the zero vector is a scalar multiple of any other vector</p>
This is a very good question and the answer is a matter of convention (definition). Our textbook (Appendix A) defined two vectors to be parallel if one is the multiple of the other. Based on this definition, $$\vec 0$$ is parallel to all other vectors (Example 4 Appendix A). Another (perhaps more common) definition of parallel vectors is &#34; two vectors are parallel if they are multiple of one another&#34;. Based on this definition $$\vec 0$$ is not parallel to other vectors. <br /><br />Now, the property you mentioned, called transitivity property, is a required property for a relation (in this instance being parallel is a relation between two vectors) to be an equivalency relation. Based on our definition, being parallel is not transitive, and hence not an equivalence relation. If one needs this relation to be transitive (there are many reasons why one might want this, but none of them apply to this course) then the second definition is teh one to go with.
This is a very good question and the answer is a matter of convention (definition). Our textbook (Appendix A) defined two vectors to be parallel if one is the multiple of the other. Based on this definition, $$\vec 0$$ is parallel to all other vectors (Example 4 Appendix A). Another (perhaps more common) definition of parallel vectors is &#34; two vectors are parallel if they are multiple of one another&#34;. Based on this definition $$\vec 0$$ is not parallel to other vectors. <br /><br />Now, the property you mentioned, called transitivity property, is the required property for a relation (in this instance being parallel is a relation between two vectors) to be an equivalency relation. Based on our definition, being parallel is not transitive, and hence not an equivalence relation. If one needs this relation to be transitive (there are many reasons why one might want this, but none of them apply to this course) then the second definition is teh one to go with. "

</div>","<p>If a transformation is injective, it maps every vector input to a unique vector output. That is, you can be sure that if $$T(\overrightarrow{v})=T(\overrightarrow{w})$$ then $$\overrightarrow{v} = \overrightarrow{w}$$. In words, you can be sure that if two transformed vectors are the same, then their inputs are the same. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, the question asks if two different inputs can yield the same output. In terms of injectivity, it is essentially asking if N is injective or not. If N is not injective, then it would be possible for your brain to perceive two different colors as the same. If N is injective, then it would not be possible. To determine injectivity, you should look for a unique solution, which can be done by taking $$rref(N)$$. In this case, $$rref(N)$$ has a rank of 3, or has a pivot in every column, meaning it is consistent with a unique solution, thus it is injective, so the above scenario would be impossible. On the contrary, if the rank was only 2, then if N was consistent, it would be possible for two different colors to be perceived as the same color since there is no unique solution.</p>"

"How to prove Det(A) = Det(A^T): Hello. I have a question regarding how can I prove Det(A) = Det(A^T), and is there an geometrical meaning for the A^T?

Rows of $$A$$ are columns of $$A^T$$ and vice versa. $$A$$ and $$A^T$$ represent two different transformations that with teh same expansion factor.

So, I printed up the page at 150% sizing in order to carefully measure the distances and try to understand what is going on - where is the scale of the diagram wrong?<br /><br />Then, I realized that it does not matter. The outer, dashed lines do not represent anything to do with the <strong>stance</strong> of the person - the statics of the position are determined by the crutches, not by the dashed lines.  I looked further down and found that the lines represent how far out the crutches are swung as a person takes a step, which is excellent for us to know in general, but the ramp in Hart House is wide enough that it does not matter.</p>

Are the body proportions missing from the given information? If not, are we then just supposed to research these proportions or give random estimates? Those seem like the only two options with the information we are given.","This question is different from a typical question you get in a math class in a few ways, and is intended to model a real-world problem that you may be given to investigate. Unlike classroom carefully designed examples, problems in applied context come with incomplete and at times inconsistent data. <br /><br />The limited data in this question is part of that design. The data is directly taken from an old sourcebook &#34;<i>Human Dimension and Interior Space&#34;</i>.  You are expected to use the proportions of the given figure (you can measure the figure yourself and scale it down/up to the right proportion. This process may result in some discrepancy in your data which you should decide how to address) the assumption that weight is evenly distributed to estimate the average length of body parts and their weights. "

"Redundant Column Vector Clarification: <p>In today&#39;s lecture, we deduced that v1 and v2 are the basis of the im(T), and that v3 and v4 are redundant since you can write them in terms of v1 and v2.

Being redundant is not an intrinsic property of a vector. Indeed, we are able to create another basis for $$im(T)$$ that does not contain $$\vec v_1$$.

You can model the body part as a cube, then distribute the weight evenly to the vertices of the curve, and use the center of the mass formula (from HW1) to determine the center of the mass of that part, OR for a course estimate, you can allocate the mass to teh geometrical center of that body part.

The process is still a little confusing to me, and I&#39;m having trouble understanding/visualizing why the standard vectors specifically are used?<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />VP</p>",The use of standard vectors comes from how we constructed teh standard matrix of a LT using the linearity of the map.

Which means 100% of the volume is the same as 100% of the weight. <br />So if you get a body part is 10% of the total volume, then that body part is also 10% of the total weight. It should not be that much off from the total weight. "

"Linearly independent vectors in a set: <p>Hello,</p>
<p>If we are given a set of 4 vectors that span R^4, how would we determine which of the given vectors are linearly dependent? If we were to row reduce the matrix whose columns are the vectors, how would we tell which of the vectors is linearly independent and which ones are linearly dependent?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>","&#34;Linearly independent and dependent&#34; is a term used for a collection of vectors. We can not say a single vector inside a larger collection is linearly dependent or independent. Any set that contains a single nonzero vector is linearly independent. <br /><br />What you want to ask is how do I know which vectors are redundant and I can remove them from the collection without changing the span of the collection. You can so that by creating a matrix A whose columns are your vectors and by finding a nontrivial vector in the kernel of A. Any such vector gives you a nontrivial linear relation which you can use to write one of your vectors as a lc of the rest, and the repeat the process. <br /><br />If you have 4 vectors that span $$\mathbb R^4$$, because you know the dimension of the space, and you have the right number of vectors, your vectors have to be linearly independent. "

"Image: <p>How do I find the vectors that span a image given a matrix?</p>
<p></p>","<p>Firstly, what is the image of a matrix? The matrix you have learned is a linear transformation. The image of a transformation $$T$$ that maps $$x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$$ to $$y \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$$ would be the set of all outputs $$y \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$$, given the set of all inputs in $$x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$$, that this transformation can produce. <br /><br />In simpler terms if you had a matrix such that:</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>then when you give it distinct inputs with distinct {$$x_{1}$$,$$x_{2}$$,$$x_{3}$$} values, you will get distinct outputs with distinct {$$y_{1}$$,$$y_{2}$$,$$y_{3}$$} values, which in the case of the identity matrix given above are the same as the input. So, if you give it as input all of the vectors in $$ \mathbb{R}^{3}$$ you would get all of $$ \mathbb{R}^{3}$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Now in terms of notation, we refer to the set of outputs as the im$$(T)$$ or the im$$(A)$$ for a given matrix A. In the example provided above the output can be presented as: </p>

Free variables - Basis of a kernel and Image: What is the relationship between free variables and the basis of a kernel? Also what is the difference between the basis of an image and the basis of the kernel?,"<p>Great question!</p>
<p></p>
<p>A matrix you have learned is one form to represent a linear transformation or a map, of a vector $$\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$$ to a vector $$\vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$$; or to say $$T(\vec{x}) = \vec{y}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So far so good, we pick vectors in $$\mathbb{R}^{m}$$ and map them to vectors in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$. But let&#39;s suppose m&gt;n, that means that if you &#34;count&#34; the vectors belonging to $$\mathbb{R}^{m}$$ there are more of them than there are vectors in $$\mathbb{R}^{n}$$, because we assume m&gt;n and thus $$\mathbb{R}^{m}$$ is of a higher dimension than $$\mathbb{R}^{n}$$. One would panic in such a case! But rest assured, those &#34;extra&#34; vectors are actually mapped to the black hole of linear algebra, the zero vector $$\vec{0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$$. By this reasoning we can resolve this ambiguity by defining two subspaces of interest to us: the image and the kernel of a transformation T or a matrix A, or im(A) and ker(A). </p>
<p></p>
<p>Image of A, im(A), is the set of all vectors that a transformation defined by a matrix A can produce. So, for example if you had a matrix A such that: </p>
<p></p>
<p>$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$ and $$\vec{y} = A\vec{x} :\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, for $$\vec{x}$$ defined as $$\begin{bmatrix} x_{1}\\ x_{2}\\ x_{3} \end{bmatrix}$$ the output $$\vec{y}$$ will be $$\begin{bmatrix} x_{1}\\ x_{2}\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So we can see that even though $$\vec{y}$$ is an element of $$\mathbb{R}^{m}$$ it is actually a 2 dimensional object. We say that the dimension of the image is 2. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The kernel on the other hand is the set of all input vectors $$\vec{x}$$ that give an input of $$\vec{0}$$. In this case any vector $$\vec{x}$$ of the form $$\begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 0\\ s \end{bmatrix}$$, where s is a random variable, will give an output of $$\vec{0}$$. That is easy to verify by just multiplying this general vector by the matrix A given above. Even though the kernel is an element of $$\mathbb{R}^{m}$$ it forms a subspace of dimension 1, a line, so we say that the dimension of the kernel is 1. </p>
<p></p>
<p>From this example you can see that you can find the dimension of the image and the kernel of a square matrix by analyzing the matrix in its reduced row echelon form. Where the number of free variables will give you the dimension of the kernel and the number of leading variables will give you the dimension of the image. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For more information on representing the answer in terms of basis vectors and span you can look at my previous answer @467. </p>

<p>This concepts can get a bit convoluted so let&#39;s break up this problem a little bit, some of this is a repetition of the PCE, so fill free to refer to the PCE if there are parts you don&#39;t understand or post another question asking for more details. <br /><br />Firstly if you refer a bit back in the PCE, &#34;P&#34; is a subspace of $$\mathbb{R}^{3}$$ defined by the equation $$x+y+z=0$$. This particular subspace is plane, which means it can be defined as the span of any two linearly independent vectors that lie in that plane. For the example, those can be the vectors that form the basis of $$\mathcal{B}$$ or the vectors that form the basis of $$\mathcal{C}$$. So, both those pairs of vectors can be used to define the subspace P. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, when we talk about bases, we usually use them in the context of coordinates. In other words, we can describe points in space, in terms of different vectors other than the unit vectors of $$\vec{e}$$ that we are used to. In this example we can write vector $$\vec{v}$$ such that:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\vec{v} = 1*\vec{b}_{1} + 1*\vec{b}_{2}$$, where $$\vec{v}$$ = $$\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 1\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$ = $$1*$$$$\begin{bmatrix} -1\\ -1\\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$$ &#43; $$1*$$$$\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ -1\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, $$\begin{bmatrix} \vec{v}\end{bmatrix}_{\mathcal{B}}$$ = $$\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>That saves space when we write stuff, both in our notebook pages and in our computer memories. If you think about the example above you can express a point with two numbers instead of 3. One can extend this to higher dimensional spaces, think of a long excel spreadsheet with many numbers in it. That can be one application though not the only one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are all good in terms of expressing $$\vec{v}$$ in terms of basis $$\mathcal{B}$$, or even the basis $$\mathcal{C}$$, it&#39;s the same idea. But how can we finesse linear algebra and jump straight from the coordinates defined with basis $$\mathcal{B}$$ to coordinates defined with basis $$\mathcal{C}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you try to represent the first vector in the basis of $$\mathcal{B}$$ in terms of the basis of $$\mathcal{C}$$ you get this: </p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\vec{b}_{1} = \begin{bmatrix} -1\\-1\\2 \end{bmatrix} = s_{11}* \vec{u}_{1} + s_{21}*\vec{u}_{2} = s_{11}* \begin{bmatrix} -2\\-2\\4 \end{bmatrix} + s_{21}*\begin{bmatrix} 0\\1\\-1 \end{bmatrix} $$</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the above equation one can see by inspection or solve to find that $$s_{11} = \frac{1}{2}$$ and $$s_{21} = 0$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you try to represent the second vector in the basis of $$\mathcal{B}$$ in terms of the basis of $$\mathcal{C}$$ you get this: </p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\vec{b}_{2} = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\-1\\0 \end{bmatrix} = s_{12}* \vec{u}_{1} + s_{22}*\vec{u}_{2} = s_{12}* \begin{bmatrix} -2\\-2\\4 \end{bmatrix} + s_{22}*\begin{bmatrix} 0\\1\\-1 \end{bmatrix} $$</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the above equation one can see by inspection or solve to find that $$s_{12} = -\frac{1}{2}$$ and $$s_{22} = -2$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>That transformation turns out to be linear and it can be represented by a matrix. Because in this case you go from a representation with 2 coordinates to a representation with 2 coordinates, you kind of know this has to be a 2 by 2 matrix, just based on the matrix operations required and how matrix operations work. <br /><br />So, we define a matrix $$S_{B \rightarrow C}$$ such that: </p>
<p></p>
<p>$$S_{B \rightarrow C} = \begin{bmatrix} s_{11} & s_{12} \\ s_{21} & s_{22} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} &  -\frac{1}{2}\\0  & -2 \end{bmatrix}$$</p>

<p>This concepts can get a bit convoluted so let&#39;s break up this problem a little bit, some of this is a repetition of the PCE, so fill free to refer to the PCE if there are parts you don&#39;t understand or post another question asking for more details. <br /><br />Firstly if you refer a bit back in the PCE, &#34;P&#34; is a subspace of $$\mathbb{R}^{3}$$ defined by the equation $$x+y+z=0$$. This particular subspace is plane, which means it can be defined as the span of any two linearly independent vectors that lie in that plane. For the example, those can be the vectors that form the basis of $$\mathcal{B}$$ or the vectors that form the basis of $$\mathcal{C}$$. So, both those pairs of vectors can be used to define the subspace P. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, when we talk about bases, we usually use them in the context of coordinates. In other words, we can describe points in space, in terms of different vectors other than the unit vectors of $$\vec{e}$$ that we are used to. In this example we can write vector $$\vec{v}$$ such that:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\vec{v} = 1*\vec{b}_{1} + 1*\vec{b}_{2}$$, such that $$\vec{v}$$ = $$\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 1\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$ = $$1*$$$$\begin{bmatrix} -1\\ -1\\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$$ &#43; $$1*$$$$\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ -1\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, $$\begin{bmatrix} \vec{v}\end{bmatrix}_{\mathcal{B}}$$ = $$\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>That saves space when we write stuff, both in our notebook pages and in our computer memories. If you think about the example above you can express a point with two numbers instead of 3. One can extend this to higher dimensional spaces, think of a long excel spreadsheet with many numbers in it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We are all good in terms of expressing $$\vec{v}$$ in terms of basis $$\mathcal{B}$$ let&#39;s say or even the basis $$\mathcal{C}$$, it&#39;s the same idea. But how can we finesse linear algebra and jump straight from the coordinates defined with basis $$\mathcal{B}$$ to coordinates defined with basis $$\mathcal{C}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you try to represent the first vector in the basis of $$\mathcal{B}$$ in terms of the basis of $$\mathcal{C}$$ you get this: </p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\vec{b}_{1} = \begin{bmatrix} -1\\-1\\2 \end{bmatrix} = s_{11}* \vec{u}_{1} + s_{21}*\vec{u}_{2} = s_{11}* \begin{bmatrix} -2\\-2\\4 \end{bmatrix} + s_{21}*\begin{bmatrix} 0\\1\\-1 \end{bmatrix} $$</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the above equation one can see by inspection or solve to find that $$s_{11} = \frac{1}{2}$$ and $$s_{21} = 0$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you try to represent the second vector in the basis of $$\mathcal{B}$$ in terms of the basis of $$\mathcal{C}$$ you get this: </p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\vec{b}_{2} = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\-1\\0 \end{bmatrix} = s_{12}* \vec{u}_{1} + s_{22}*\vec{u}_{2} = s_{12}* \begin{bmatrix} -2\\-2\\4 \end{bmatrix} + s_{22}*\begin{bmatrix} 0\\1\\-1 \end{bmatrix} $$</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the above equation one can see by inspection or solve to find that $$s_{12} = -\frac{1}{2}$$ and $$s_{22} = -2$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>That transformation turns out to be linear and it can be represented by a matrix. Because in this case you go from a representation with 2 coordinates to a representation with 2 coordinates, you kind of know this has to be a 2 by 2 matrix, just based on the matrix operations required and how matrix operations work. <br /><br />So, we define a matrix $$S_{B \rightarrow C}$$ such that: </p>
<p></p>
<p>$$S_{B \rightarrow C} = \begin{bmatrix} s_{11} & s_{12} \\ s_{21} & s_{22} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} &  -\frac{1}{2}\\0  & -2 \end{bmatrix}$$</p>

<p></p>
<p>$$ \vec v=\vec v\cdot \vec v_1 \vec v_1+\vec v\cdot \vec v_2\vec v_2 $$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, since you want $$\vec v$$ as a linear combination of $$\vec u_i$$&#39;s and not $$\vec v_i$$, let&#39;s replace $$\vec v_i$$&#39;s with $$\vec u_i/\|\vec u_i\|$$. You will get the formula in the students answer. </p>

<p>So how exactly is &lt;3,3,-3&gt; in the span of &lt;-1,0,1&gt; (the orthogonal complement)? Did I do something wrong?</p>","<p>for the vector v=[ 3 3 -3]<br />we can calculate the dot product of v with every vector in W</p>
<p>v·(x, y, x&#43;y)= 3x&#43;3y &#43;(-3) * (x&#43;y)<br />= 3x&#43; 3y -3x -3y =0</p>
<p>for v to be orthogonal to W, the dot product should be zero for all vectors (x, y, x&#43;y) in W. in this case. the dot product is always zero, no matter of the values of x and y.</p>
<p>therefore v= [ 3 3 -3] is orthogonal to W</p>

First, find a basis for $$W$$ (one of your vectors is not in $$W$$), then $$W^\perp$$ will be all teh vectors that are perpendicular to all of the vectors in your basis. "

"Textbook 3.2 Q4: <p>Hello, I was wondering if someone can help me out with this question. I know a subspace need to contain the zero vector and be closed under addition and multiplication but I&#39;m not sure how to prove if the span is/isnt a subspace. If anyone can help me out that&#39;d be great! </p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider the vectors v1, v2, . . . , vm in Rn. Is span (v1, . . . , vm) necessarily a subspace of Rn? Justify your answer.</p>","<p>I remember in class noting that a span is always a subspace - here is my explanation for satisfying the three criteria of a subset:<br />- Contains 0 vector: span is the set of all linear combinations of the vectors, so which includes multiplying all vectors by 0 to obtain the zero vector.</p>
<p>- closed under scalar multiplication: the product of multiplying any vector in the set by a scalar is still a linear combination (in the span) of the vectors - if it were 3 times $$\overrightarrow v_2$$ for example, the linear combination would be $$0\overrightarrow v_1+3\overrightarrow v_2+0\overrightarrow v_3+...+0\overrightarrow v_n$$</p>
<p>- closed under vector addition: similar to the explanation for scalar multiplication, vector addition is a fundamental part of span of the vectors through their linear combinations, so the set must be closed under scalar addition</p>"

Of course, we have a precise definition of what a linear map is. however, roughly speaking, a linear map is a function that modifies vectors while respecting their addition and scalar multiplication.

Orthogonal compliment and kernel: Is the orthogonal compliment of a vector in a subspace just the span of the kernel/null space because when you take the dot product of a vector and it’s kernel it equals zero? I’ve also read that it’s the kernel of the transpose but I’m not sure if that’s the same thing as what I described above. ,"The null space is the orthogonal complement to the row space, while the left null space (or the kernel of the transpose) is the orthogonal complement to the column space. 
<p>Orthogonal complement is defined for a subspace, and not for a vector. You can talk about the orthogonal complement to the span of a vector for instance. It seems that your question is about the connection between the orthogonal complement of the column space of a matrix and the kernel of its transpose.  Let $$A$$ be a matrix. then $$col(A)^\perp=\ker (A^T)$$.

<p>Thank you!</p>","<p>Like the midterm question that many people have asked about, you don&#39;t actually have to find the matrix of the transformation for this question. I was just working through this section too, and it is a bit tricky. </p>
<p>A diagonal matrix is a matrix which has non-zeroes in the diagonal entries and zeroes everywhere else. To ensure that the matrix for T is diagonal, for this question about reflecting over a line, one of the basis vectors should be parallel to the line, while the other two are simply two different perpendicular (dot product with first vector = 0), non-zero vectors (in R3). You can see that the solution shows exactly that:</p>

<p>For questions about reflecting over a plane in R3, you just take two vectors that span the plane (by subbing in two values into the equation of the plane and solving for the third value, to obtain two linearly independent variables), and then the normal vector to the plane, which would be the cross product of the two vectors that span the plane, or more simply, the coefficients of the variables in the scalar equation of the plane.</p>

The procedure that we use to find the matrix of the transformation in the new basis is $$B=S^{-1}AS$$, where S is the matrix made by the basis vectors, and A is given. Then you just perform matrix multiplication.
You seem to be finding one of the two changes of basis matrices. The change of basis can be used as described in the student&#39;s answer above. However, for this question, it is way easier to find $$[T]_\mathcal B$$ directly. Recall that the columns of $$[T]_\mathcal B$$   are $$[T(\vec v_i)]_\mathcal B$$. Plugging $$\vec v_i$$&#39;s in we get $$T(\vec v_1)=\vec v_1$$ and $$T(\vec v_2)=-\vec v_2$$. The next step is to find their $$\mathcal B$$ coordinates. "
"Writing a transformation Matrix in terms of a non-standard basis: To write any transformation matrix in terms of a non-standard basis B, do we simply apply the transformation to the vectors given in the basis B, and those vectors become the columns of our transformation Matrix with respect to the basis B? ","The columns of the map $$T$$ with respect to a basis $$\mathcal B$$ are the $$\mathcal B$$-cordinates of output of vectors in $$\mathcal B$$.

"Marking Gateway?: How exactly are the gateways marked? Are they marked based on the score we got (the one out of 5 or 6 points), or are they marked based on the number of learning standards we successfully show?

<p>Hi, I am not sure how this is the answer for q2 of the 2022 midterm. I understand that we are using determinants to solve it but how do we begin to approach this type of problem? Could someone please explain? Thanks!</p>","<p>There was a similar thing to this in Tutorial 5 DEV.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start by writing everything in terms of the detA:</p>
<ul><li>detB=-detA because R2 and R3 are swapped, which multiplies the determinant by -1, and adding another row (or a multiple of another row) does not alter the determinant.</li><li>detC=2detA because R1 swaps with R2, which multiplies det by -1, then the new R2 swaps with R3, which multiplies det by -1 again, meaning the deteminant is no longer negative. Then, the first row is multiplied by a scalar 2, which has the effect of multiplying the determinant by 2, and add the third row to the first row which does nothing to the determinant.</li></ul>
<p>Now, we are given detA=4, so detB=-4, detC=8.</p>
<p>Part 1: we just solved it! detC=8</p>
<p>Part 2: determinant represents geometrically the ratio of volume change, so use the corresponding determinants like so: Volume = (detA)(detB)(initial volume) = (4)(-4)(5) = -80, and I guess they just took the absolute value.</p>
<p>Part 3: use the property det($$C^{-1}B$$)=det$$C^{-1}$$detB. The determinant of the inverse of a matrix is the reciprocal of that matrix&#39;s determinant, so det$$C^{-1}$$=1/8. Multiply det$$C^{-1}$$detB=(1/8)(-4)=-1/2</p>

"Projection onto a subspace: <p>If I have a basis B=(v1,v2,v3) and I am given information that my basis is orthogonal or orthonormal, then if I have any vector x that I want to write with respect to basis B, will writing this vector with respect to the basis be the same as finding the projection of the vector onto the basis? </p>
<p></p>
<p>I am confused, because I watched the prep101 videos, in which they gave us a formula for the projection of a vector onto a subspace... </p>

I was wondering if least square approximations are something we should take into account when studying for the midterm as they are rarely mentioned in the readings and I do not recall their presence in lectures.,"The answer would then likely be no.

<p>First, reread Read PCE 7 Expand. The example there is not exactly the same, but the ideas used are similar. </p>

<p>You correctly noticed that the first two vectors are on the plane and the third one isn&#39;t. That is the first step in seeing how this basis is formed. Ignoring the first vector, convince yourself that the fact the first two vectors are in P is indeed enough to have the first two columns of $$[T]_\mathcal B$$ being what they are. <br /><br />Next, look closely at the third vector and see what you can say about how it is situated with respect to the plane. Once you have an answer for this, first make sure you can justify why $$\mathcal B$$ is a basis for $$\mathbb R^3$$, then think about why the third column of $$[T]_\mathcal B$$  is what it is. <br /><br /><br /><br /></p>"

<p>For 3a, I understand that the transposed matrix is equivalent to the inverted matrix for a square matrix. Therefore, since the second row is a multiple of the first row, the transposed matrix will NOT be independent. However, I don&#39;t understand how the determinant is 0 if it is NOT linearly independent, since I thought the determinant is 0 if the matrix is linearly independent. </p>","If the column vectors of a matrix are linearly independent, then if you row reduce it, the matrix will end up as an identity matrix. If you take the determinant of an identity matrix, you will get a non-zero value.
&#34;the matrix is invertible&#34; iff &#34;the determinant is nonzero&#34; iff &#34;the rows (or cols) are linearly independent&#34;."

<p>For this question, I thought the answer was true. My original thought process was to separate the image into &lt;3,-6&gt;, &lt;-2,4&gt;, and &lt;5,-10&gt;, which tells us that &lt;5,-10&gt; is dependent. This means that two of them are independent, also meaning that the dimension is two. Also looking at the answer key, the fact that the Kernel is 1, the image should be 2, as the vector space is in R3 and Dim(Kernel)&#43;Dim(Img)=3.</p>","<p>I think they may have mixed up the wording in the solution. You can immediately tell that $$dim(im(T))$$$$= 1$$ because $$col(T) = span(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix})$$ and from the given RREF $$ker(T) = span(\begin{bmatrix} 2/3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix} -5/3 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix})$$  therefore $$dim(ker(T)) = 2$$</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
Nevermind, I am unable to read.
Note that &lt;3, -6&gt;, &lt;-2, 4&gt; and &lt;5, -10&gt; are all dependent, so the image of the dimension is 1. I believe the solution is incorrect in stating that the dimension of the kernel is 1."

Or is it that the change of basis matrix is actually S in B = (S^-1)(A)(S)?</p>

Some very large determinants are very easy to compute (i.e. if they have a row or column of zeroes they are = 0, if they have a row of all zeroes and one non-zero you can use Laplace etc.). You can also compute a determinant by finding its REF form (keeping track of row swaps and scalar multiplications), and then using the diagonal property. For very large determinants, like those sometimes in the textbook, you can use patterns but we were told we were not expected to know these. "

Thank you.","<p>If your rank(A) &gt; columns of A, for a matrix A in rref, that means that you have a pivot point in the augmented section of your matrix yielding 0=1 which would be inconsistent. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A consistent solution entails both (1 solution) and (infinite solutions).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes a matrix can consistent if it row reduces and has a row of 0&#39;s at the bottom and the augmented is also 0.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
You are correct in that a consistent system implies having one or infinitely many solutions. If you have a row of all zeros, augmented by a 0, that does result in a consistent system. To check if a system is consistent, check to see if there is a contradiction obtained during solving. If so, then the system is inconsistent. Else, the system is consistent. So, you&#39;ve thought of the main facets; hope this helps!"

<p>The two solutions provided do not explicitly define the kernel, they just frame the problem of what you are looking for in two ways (left side solution says you are looking for all vectors which map to the zero vector; the right side solution (although not fully correct) seems to suggest that you&#39;re looking for vectors that when multiplied by that matrix, yield the zero vector). </p>

(Basically what Zain said)<br /><br />Determinant being zero means it&#39;s not invertible. For a 3x3 matrix, this is when the rank isn&#39;t 3. Since the first two columns are linearly independent, the rank is already at least two, and it would only not be 3 if the third column is in the span of the first two columns.<br /><br />Therefore, the span of the other two columns is the set of vectors that would make the determinant equal to zero.

<p>When an eigenvalue = 0, I think this implies that the eigenvector is in the kernel of the transformation. Remember that if an eigenvalue = 0 for some vector v1, then A*v1 = 0. Not every arbitrary vector will satisfy A*v = 0, so not any vector here could be an eigenvector (though there could be infinitely many eigenvectors with an eigenvalue = 0 where infinitely many != every vector). In this case, we care about finding an eigenbasis. </p>"

"Error in Midterm II posted solutions: <p>For Part B, question 4 the answer listed on the posted solutions is &#34;True,&#34; however, there is a clear error in this claim.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The question asks us to determine whether the following syllogism is true:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Premises:</strong></p>
<p>A is an invertible matrix</p>
<p>B is an invertible matrix</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>AB is an invertible matrix</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>To show a mathematical claim is false, we must show that it does not always hold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider the following case:</p>
<p>A=I₂</p>
<p>B=I₃</p>
<p></p>
<p>A and B clearly meet both premises of the question. The identity matrix of dimension 2 is invertible, and the identity matrix of dimension 3 is invertible. Then, by virtue of what the question is claiming, we must be able to conclude, <strong>based on this information alone</strong>, that the conclusion listed above is true.</p>
<p>Does the listed conclusion hold? That is, is AB invertible? No, it does not hold.</p>
<p>AB=I₂I₃. This does not even exist. Therefore, the conclusion &#34;AB is invertible&#34; is a false conclusion, which means that the mathematical claim being made in this question does NOT always hold, making the answer false.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The grading for this question should be inverted (i.e. choosing &#34;False&#34; should be the option graded as correct). Though this level of logical precision may have been difficult for some to notice during the test, it is completely unfair to those of us who did notice it to be deducted marks.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For additional clarification of where the mistake in the listed proof is, the mistake is in writing the equality det(AB)=det(A)det(B). The reason writing this equality is a mistake is because this equality holds <strong>if and only if </strong>the dimensions of A are equal to the dimensions of B. This is not a justified assumption. The question does not say &#34;Let A and B be <strong>n x n </strong>invertible matrices,&#34; or anything similar that would allow us to conclude the validity of this equality.</p>","I think it is a fair assumption that AB exists for this question to be asked.
<p>As the comment above says, there is some implication that the quantity $$AB$$ makes sense. I understand that midterms sometimes have some... wildcard questions... but it would be out of pocket for the drawn conclusion to be that the matrices are not well-defined for multiplication. </p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p></p>
<p>I was thinking about the property of a decomposition; that is, A^m can be decomposed as P*X^m*inv(P) where X is a diagonal matrix. Maybe we can find some values along the diagonal where the entries will never all be positive. Any negative number squared would be positive; any positive number squared would be positive. I think the only value that would work is zero, since zero^m for m is any real number is zero which is not positive. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus maybe any transition matrix that can be decomposed so that the diagonal matrix X contains a zero along the diagonal would be irregular? </p>

"PCE 10 Question: Hi, I just wanted to make sure if my understanding was correct for PCE 10, specifically the expand section. <br /><br />So to find the eigenvectors for a given linear transformation we have to first find its eigenvalues which can be done by computing the characteristic polynomial of the matrix.<br /><br />Then using the eigenvalues you can find the eigenspace of transformation in order to find our eigenvalues. You can do this by looking for the kernel basis of A-λIn where λ is some eigenvalue. <br /><br />After doing that you should get the span of some vector in which is also going to be part of your eigenbasis. And you basically repeat this process for all eigenvalues until you find all of the spanning sets of eigenvectors??<br /><br />Please let me know if I am understanding this correctly.

Properties of Diagonalisation: What does diagonalisation tell us about a matrix?,"Conceptually, if a matrix is diagonalizable, the eigenbasis is the best basis you can use to look at the underlying linear transformation. Using the eigenbasis to describe the linear transformation, you can clearly see how the map changes the space, in which directions (eigenspaces), and by what factors (eigenvalue)."
