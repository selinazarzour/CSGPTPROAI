<p></p>
<p>for the second one, the result is equivalent to $$\frac{n}{2}(n+1)$$. to see why this form is true, consider pairing up 1 with the last number n, 2 with the second last number n-1, and adding these pairs. you&#39;ll see that each pair adds to $$n+1$$. since we have n numbers, there are n/2 pairs, hence the sum is the sum of each pair multiplied by the number of pairs, or $$\frac{n}{2}(n+1)$$</p>"

<p></p>
<p>Also, $$\{S_n\}$$ refers to the sequences of Riemann sums associated with the $$P_n$$&#39;s, where $$S_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n}f(c_i)\Delta t_i$$. Where our $$\Delta t_i$$ is the length of our ith sub-interval of our partition $$P_n$$ and our $$c_i$$ is a value in our ith sub-interval of our partition $$P_n$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Putting these together we see that the statement is saying:</p>
<p>If there exists a unique value $$I \in \mathbb{R}$$ such that if we have <em>any</em> sequence of partitions which satisfy $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\|P_n\| = 0$$, i.e. our largest sub-interval goes to zero as n goes to $$\infty$$, then for <em>any</em> sequence of Riemann sums associated with these $$P_n$$&#39;s we have that the limit of our sequence of Riemann sums approaches this unique value $$I$$, i.e. $$\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = I$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notice: This tells us that <em>IF</em> our function in integrable, we may partition $$[a,b]$$ in <em>ANY</em> way as long as the largest sub-interval of this partition gets really small as $$n \to \infty$$ and we may choose <em>any </em>$$c_i \in [t_{i-1},t_i]$$ for our Riemann sums and we will still get the same unique value of $$I$$ for our integral.</p>

<p>I googled &#34;desmos riemann sum visualization&#34; and found this: <a href=""https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tgyr42ezjq"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tgyr42ezjq</a> . I think this does a really good job showing what is happening as you change the value of n - the norm of our partitions become smaller and our Riemann sums become a better approximation of the area under the curve as n gets large. However, note that in this visualization the partitions are &#34;regular n-partitions&#34; and the $$c_i$$&#39;s are all chosen in the same way both of which our theorem doesn&#39;t require us to do!</p>

<p>1. For the summation shown below, it&#39;s trying to represent the the estimate of the area right? As in, it would be (1/10 * 1/100) &#43; (1/10 * 4/100)&#43;......</p>

<p>2. I noticed in our lessons and the videos posted in the weekly practice problems that we used the second formula (as shown below in the picture) a lot. I was wondering if how the summation equals the right side was something we learned in class, or just a formula we have to know</p>

<p></p>","<p>1. Yes, the sum represents the area of the sum of the rectangles which is an estimate of the area under the curve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. If a &#34;calculate the Riemann sum&#34; question appears on a evaluation the required summation formulas would be provided. The proofs/derivations of these formulas is something that may have been covered in Math 135 and they can be proved by induction (or by construction).</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. $$S_n$$ represents the Riemann Sum of a partition $$P_n$$, in the picture you provided for your first question we could call this sum $$S_{10}$$ as it represents the Riemann sum of a partition with 10 sub-intervals. More intuitively, $$S_n$$ represents the area of the rectangles which we are using to approximate the area under the curve. In this limit that you provided, the value of $$s$$ would be the value of the area under the curve (if the function is integrable), i.e. the limit value of the sequence of $$S_n$$&#39;s.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note: The value $$s$$ is really just the limit of a sequence (since each $$S_n$$ is really just a number which represents the area of a collection of rectangles) and so <em>if</em> the sequence $$\{S_n\}$$ doesn&#39;t converge then this $$s$$ doesn&#39;t exist. There do exist functions where $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\{S_n\}$$ does not exist for any partition depending on the chosen $$c_i$$&#39;s (see question 4 on the practice problems). There are also functions where $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\{S_n\}$$ is <em>not </em>the same for every sequence of $$S_n$$&#39;s and can vary depending on the chosen values of $$c_i$$ or the partition. Thus if we have an arbitrary function this is not necessarily true for all sequences $$\{S_n\}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aside: This is why we define integrable in the way that we do on page 15 of the course notes! We say that our function is integrable on $$[a,b]$$ if there exists a <em>unique </em>$$s \in \mathbb{R}$$ such that $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\{S_n\} = s$$ for <em>any</em> sequence of Riemann Sums, $$\{S_n\}$$, provided that our sequence of corresponding partitions satisfies $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\|P_n\|=0$$.</p>

For a question that involves calculating $$\int_a^b f(x) \, dx$$ using a Riemann, if $$f(x)$$ is integrable, then you have free reign over which partitioning to use and which sample points $$c_i$$ to use. Using pen and paper, the regular right-hand Riemann sum is (arguably) easiest to use.

However, we can ask questions related to other Riemann sums. IIRC, there&#39;s at least one question on the practice quiz that requires knowledge of the left-hand Riemann sum."
Riemann Sum to Definite Int: If the bottom limit of the sum was 0 and the upper was n-1 would this be using left riemann sum? If so how does this change the way we approach the solution? ,"<p>The bottom limit of the sum being 0 and upper limit was $$(n-1)$$ this would amount to us labelling our sub-intervals differently. i.e. our zeroth interval would be $$[t_0, t_1]$$ - which normally we would say is our first interval and our $$\Delta t_0 = t_1 - t_0$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This would not be using a left Riemann sum. Our left and right Riemann sums refer to the $$c_i$$&#39;s that we are choosing in the sub-intervals not the way that we label/index our sub-intervals.</p>"

<p>Given a function $$f$$ on $$[a,b]$$ and a partition $$P$$ on $$[a,b]$$, and a set $$\{c_1, c_2, \cdots, c_n\}$$ where $$c_i \in [t_{i-1},t_i]$$. Then a Riemann sum for $$f$$ with respect to $$P$$ is:</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align:center""> $$S = \sum_{i=1}^{n}f(c_i)\Delta t_i$$</p>
<p style=""text-align:center""></p>
<p style=""text-align:left"">Notice that we are given that the $$x_i$$&#39;s are a point in the $$i$$th sub-interval so these can be viewed as our $$c_i$$&#39;s. We are also given that the partition is regular so we have that $$\Delta t_i = \frac{b-a}{n} = \frac{7-1}{n} = \frac{6}{n}$$.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left""></p>
<p style=""text-align:left"">Then by inspection we can see that our $$f(c_i) = f(x_i) = (\frac{e^{x_i}}{x_i})$$ and our $$\Delta t_i = \frac{6}{n}$$. From here we can use the definition of our definite integral on page 16 to write out the definite integral.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left""></p>
<p style=""text-align:left""></p>
<p style=""text-align:left"">Note: I believe that when you state &#34;$$f(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{x_i} = 1 + \frac{6i}{n}$$&#34; you are assuming that we are using the Right-hand Riemann Sum which we cannot do in this case because we are not given that our $$x_i$$ is the right-hand endpoint of the $$i$$th subinterval.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left""></p>
<p style=""text-align:left"">Additionally notice that in the definition of the right-hand Riemann sum we have:</p>
<p style=""text-align:left"">$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\textbf{f}(a+i(\frac{b-a}{n})) \ (\frac{b-a}{n}))$$</p>

<p>The students&#39; answer above is great! I&#39;d just like to add two things:</p>
<p>For the first question, our $$\Delta x$$ refers to the length of a sub-interval (i.e. $$\Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1}$$), and note that these do not need to all be the same length. $$\|P_n\| = max\{\Delta x_1, \Delta x_2, \cdots, \Delta x_n\}$$ and this is the length of the largest sub-interval.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the second question, the note says that it holds for all $$c \in \mathbb{R}$$, it then states that it even holds for $$c > b \textrm{ or } c < a$$. The purpose of stating this is to make it clear that this $$c$$ does not need to be in $$[a,b]$$ because as the student showed above it holds for all $$ c \in \mathbb{R}$$.</p>"

<p>3. This might be a vague question but when going over the 6 properties, our prof drew an example to explain what the properties were trying to say but I forgot which one it was for. Im guessing it&#39;s 3 but I want to be sure.</p>
<p><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flkqwdwm2tzz2kh%2F9c71c1799b6a9fa61fc667bd59f0ffd66ee3cfc9232ae854468cb3a5d5116644%2FIMG_682096DC9C1C-1.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""351"" height=""286"" /> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>","<p>1) Yes, $$\triangle t$$ represents the width of one rectangle within our partition. When we have a regular-n partition (all the widths are equal) we can represent $$\triangle t = \frac{b-a}{n}$$ where $$b-a$$ is the length of the whole interval divided by $$n$$ subsections. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The second formula is used as the terms to evaluate the function to solve the Riemann sum (possibly other applications I don&#39;t know about too). $$t_i$$ represents an arbitrary term within the partition, $$t_0$$ is the very first value in the interval (usually $$t_0 = a$$ from what I&#39;ve seen, use this for practice problems), $$\triangle t$$ is the width of one rectangle. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Basically what we&#39;re doing is computing a random instance of $$t$$ within our partition. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a diagram that will hopefully make more sense than my yapping:</p>
<p><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flkqw8iusqnz5hk%2Ffc6be16cceeb40be6f788f040c1416fc18480377ba6ffc9b94f230321d7b88fe%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.png"" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>$$t_i$$ is a placeholder for $$t_1, t_2, t_3, t_{whatever}...$$ within the interval. To calculate where it is in respect to $$t_0=a$$, we just add the width of 1 rectangle $$i$$ times. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So if I want $$t_3$$, I would do $$t_3 = t_0 + 3\triangle t$$. I&#39;m adding $$3\cdot$$ (width of rectangle) to get to $$t_3$$. Let me know if you can see this visually with my diagram, I can explain more if needed. Then you can plug this result in as the argument of your function within the definite integral and solve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Yes, or you can think of it as &#34;adding the negative area to the positive area&#34;. If they are equal then your total is 0. </p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Your assumption is correct. This was for the 3rd property from 1.3 Thm 2 (pg. 28 of course note pdf)</p>

I tried several small values of ""a"" since it will horizontally stretch the function, such as $$10^{-9}$$, which barely exceeds 2.

Question about the definition of integrability: Can anyone explain why the formal definition requires that the limit of the norm of the partition is zero?,"well if the limit of the norm didn&#39;t approach 0 as n approached infinity then that means that our rectangles would not become infinitely thin, resulting in our value still being an approximation rather than the exact value.

"Does a general antiderivative of a function that isn&#39;t continous for all x have multiple constants?: <p>For example, today we learned in class the general antiderivative of $$\sec^2(x) $$  is $$\int \sec^2(x)dx = \tan(x) +C$$, but I was wondering why isn&#39;t this defined to have multiple values of $$C$$ since $$\tan(x)$$ isn&#39;t continuous for all $$x$$? Since there&#39;s infinite points where the function isn&#39;t defined, theoretically every interval of continuity could have a different constant. For example, a function $$f(x)$$ could be defined as $$f(x) = \tan(x) + C_1$$ on $$(\frac{-\pi }{2}, \frac{\pi }{2})$$, and  $$f(x) = \tan(x) + C_2$$ on $$(\frac{\pi }{2}, \frac{3\pi }{2})$$  and so on. This would still have a derivative of $$\sec^2(x)$$, but isn&#39;t of the form $$\tan(x) + C$$ since $$C_1$$ doesn&#39;t have to equal $$C_2$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Obviously if a function is continous for all $$x$$ then you can&#39;t apply this because functions with only one interval in the domain will have to be continous where the two intervals meet, meaning the $$C$$ will need to be the same. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering if in general this is true, and if so why don&#39;t we specify these conditions when writing the general antiderivative of a function?</p>","<p>This is a great question. Yes, the &#34;&#43;C&#34; term can be different on either side of a discontinuity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, an antiderivative of $$\frac{1}{x^2}$$ is $$-\frac{1}{x}$$, and therefore we typically write the full collection of antiderivatives of $$\frac{1}{x^2}$$ as $$-\frac{1}{x}+C$$, $$C\in\mathbb{R}$$. You&#39;re correct, however, that we could use different constants here for $$x<0$$ and for $$x>0$$, since shifting the two pieces of the graph vertically won&#39;t affect the function&#39;s derivative. That is, something like</p>

<p>would also be an antiderivative.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My guess is that we don&#39;t go into such detail when reporting the antiderivatives of a function for two reasons. First, it would be a lot more cumbersome to write out our answers with that level of detail and it&#39;s just easier to remember that we <em>could</em> use different constant for different pieces of the function if we so desired. And second, this distinction isn&#39;t important when dealing with definite integrals, as the constants would cancel off when we substitute the bounds via the FTC.</p>

<p style=""text-align:center"">$$F(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}-\frac{1}{x} + 1 & \text{if}\,\,x<0\\ -\frac{1}{x} +2 & \text{if}\,\,x>0\end{array}\right.$$</p>
<p>would also be an antiderivative.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My guess is that we don&#39;t go into such detail when reporting the antiderivatives of a function for two reasons. First, it would be a lot more cumbersome to write out our answers with that level of detail and it&#39;s just easier to remember that we <em>could</em> use different constant for different pieces of the function if we so desired. And second, this distinction isn&#39;t important when dealing with definite integrals, as the constants would cancel off when we substitute the bounds via the FTC.</p>"

"How to tell if a Left/Right Riemann Sum will be an over/under estimate: <p>Hello,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am a little confused on how we tell if a left/right sum will be an over/under estimate. I know that for a positive, increasing function, the right sum will be over and the left will be under, but beyond that I am not too sure, <strong>especially</strong> when the function is not strictly positive and we start dealing with negative area.</p>

You can also consult this post: [misleading to regard dy/dx as a fraction](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/73492/how-misleading-is-it-to-regard-fracdydx-as-a-fraction?_gl=1*tfwxez*_ga*MjU4Mzk2NTc1LjE2ODU5OTEyODg.*_ga_S812YQPLT2*MTcwNTc3MDI5OC4xMTkuMS4xNzA1NzcwMzc3LjAuMC4w.)
But I don't really understand some concepts that they discuss like cotangent space and nonstandard analysis.

I feel like it's more of a historical question. When Leibniz first introduced this notation, there was no $$\epsilon - \delta$$ analysis. Both dy and dx were defined as ""infinitesimals"" - quantities assumed to be infinitely small yet still non-zero. Although being intuitive, this notion contradicts the Archimedean Property of real numbers, because no matter how many times you add the ""infinitesimals"" to itself, it will never be greater than 1. 

Treating dy/dx works fine in some scenarios, ex. inverse function derivative (that's probably the most obvious one), chain-rule analogy, linearity of derivatives, u-substitution for integrals, and related rates. But it might fail in other cases, such as implicit differentiation, partial derivatives for multi-variables, as well as higher dimensional manifolds.

<p>The antiderivatives in the table shown in the student answer are the bare minimum. You should have all of those committed to memory. (Technically, you can also derive the inverse trig ones in the table above using trig sub, but stating those outright is fine.)</p>

For this range of $$\theta$$&#39;s, it turns out that $$\tan\theta\geq 0$$, and this is what allows us to &#34;drop&#34; the absolute values during the calculation. Some texts will instead use $$\theta\in[0,\pi/2)\cup(\pi/2,\pi]$$ for the $$x=\sec\theta$$ sub, which does not have the advantage of $$\tan\theta$$ being positive on this domain.

<p></p>
<p>EDIT: The issue is indeed related to invertibility. In the example given, $$\sin(x)$$ is not invertible on $$[0,\pi]$$, thus, before we do our change of variables, we split the integral into two parts, one from $$[0,\pi/2]$$ and the other $$[\pi/2, \pi]$$. We can then proceed as usual with change of variables but with $$\cos(x) = -\sqrt{1-u^2}$$ on the $$[\pi/2, \pi]$$ interval. This will result in the same value as above.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that this doesn&#39;t mean that substitution <em>doesn&#39;t </em>work with non-invertible functions, rather, we just need to take some extra caution by splitting definite integrals into intervals where the substitution remains invertible.

<p>Suppose $$f:X\to Y$$ is integrable for (at least) $$X=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:a\leq x \leq b\} : \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \,\,b\geq a.$$ Then $$Y=\{f(x):a\leq x \leq b\}.$$ Your choices for $$f$$ must be <strong>injective (one-to-one)</strong> on $$a\leq x \leq b$$, or else the bounds a, b $$\subset X$$ may map to the same $$Y$$ value, causing the problem above.</p>
<md>To the example provided by the instructor, the u sub will be plus and minus since $$ du = cosx dx = \pm \sqrt{1-sin^2x}$$. So there are two different integrals and this will result in a positive number. I don't know the answer to the general question tho.</md>"

<p>What you&#39;re really asking about here is the domain of a composition $$f(g(x))$$. Since the input, $$x$$, must first pass through $$g$$, we must remove any points that make $$g(x)$$ undefined. So, in the case of $$\frac{1}{x^{-2}}=\frac{1}{1/x^2},$$ the inner function, $$g(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}$$, is not defined at $$x=0$$. Therefore, $$x=0$$ is not a point in the domain of the function, despite it appearing to not be an issue once the expression is simplified.</p>

<p>Another classic example is $$y=(\sqrt{x})^2$$, which is $$x$$, but only for $$x\geq 0$$. If you plot it on geogebra, for example, you&#39;ll see that nothing is shown for $$x<0$$. </p>

<p>Note that if you find that your improper integral is <strong>convergent</strong>, then choosing a different lower bound will obviously change that finite value.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Since the divergent integrals aren&#39;t finite, we could choose a bigger lower-bound, and it wouldn&#39;t make a difference.</strong>&#34;$$+\infty - 12\Rightarrow +\infty$$&#34;</p>
<p>The lower bound should be $$\geq$$1, we don&#39;t want it to get too close to the vertical asymptote at x=0.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>But Shonie what about lower bounds &gt; 1?</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Keep in mind that we are testing the convergence of a very very long interval, if your function were to diverge when using the bounds [23, &#43;$$\infty$$), your function will still diverge if you choose:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1$$\leq$$ lower bound $$\leq$$ 23.</p>

<p>Note that if you find that your improper integral is <strong>convergent</strong>, then choosing a different lower bound will obviously change that finite value.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Since the divergent integrals aren&#39;t finite, we could choose a bigger lower-bound, and it wouldn&#39;t make a difference.</strong></p>
<p>To add on to the explanation above, you can show this result by replacing the 1 in the lower limit of the integral with any number greater than 1, we can call this $$a$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then by performing the same steps as seen on page 84 and 85 of the course notes we see that our conclusion remains the same.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However it is important to note that if we change the lower bound from 1 to $$a$$, we <strong>do not necessarily</strong> have that: $$\int_a^\infty \frac{1}{x^p} = \frac{1}{p-1} $$. Instead we would have: $$\int_a^\infty \frac{1}{x^p} = \frac{a}{p-1}$$ (provided that $$p>1$$).</p>"

Linear DE: What is a for sure way to know if the DE is linear or not?,"<p>We look at all the terms with $$y, y', y''$$, etc. and basically see if anything &#34;funky&#34; is going on with them. Sometimes I think of it as looking for the highest power of $$y$$ (treating any derivative of $$y$$ as $$y$$) but there also cannot be any $$e^y, \sin(y), f(y)^2$$ and so on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m not certain on how I can define a &#34;for sure&#34; way, because it requires a little investigating sometimes, so I would recommend understanding the variety of problems that could be linear or non-linear. I&#39;ll outline a couple random examples because I think they will help more than my explanation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Linear:</p>
<p>$$e^x\cdot\cos(x^2+2x)y+y'\ln(x)=y''$$ </p>
<p>There are no terms of $$y$$ doing anything &#34;funky&#34; like being in a trig function or being multiplied together, so this is linear</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = x^7y'''$$</p>
<p>This is kinda strange because it uses both derivative notations (so probably not good form) but I wanted to illustrate that $$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} $$ is the same as $$y''$$ so this is also linear</p>
<p></p>
<p>Non-linear:</p>
<p>$$y\cdot y'=x$$</p>
<p>Since $$y$$ and $$y'$$ are multiplied together, it is non-linear</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$y^7=\cos(x)y'$$</p>
<p>This is a power of $$y$$ so non-linear (only powers of 1 are allowed)</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\cos(y')=x+2$$</p>
<p>The $$y'$$ is in a trig function so non-linear</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\sqrt y x+5 = y'$$</p>
<p>Fractional exponents are also not allowed</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a screenshot from lecture with more examples:</p>

<p></p>
<p>I hope that helps, maybe someone else has a more definite way of determining this, but this is what I do. I actually came up with some examples that confused me so I am gonna post them in a separate question if you want to refer to it as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The most general version of a linear ODE is</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$A_n(x) y^{(n)} + A_{n-1}(x) y^{(n-1)} + \dots + A_2(x) y'' + A_1(x) y' + A_0(x) y = B(x)$$,</p>

<p></p>
<p>Here&#39;s the definition from the course notes for reference, I notice it specifically says &#34;<strong>if it</strong> <strong>can be written in the form...</strong>&#34; which implies that algebraic manipulation should be okay. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Here are some examples of what I am confused about:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\frac{y}{y'}=x$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>If I move $$y'$$ to the other side then it becomes linear, and $$y\equiv0$$ wouldn&#39;t be in the domain(?) so I suppose this is a valid manipulation and it is linear?</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\cos(y')=x$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>What if I rewrite as $$y' = \arccos(x)$$ (assuming I ensure my domain is invertible), would this count as linear?</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\ln(y')=x$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>What if I manipulate this to be $$y' = e^x$$?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>","<p>This is an interesting question. I would probably lean on the side of &#34;yes, if you can modify the expression into $$y' + P(x) y =Q(x)$$, then it is a first order linear ODE&#34; (and similar for anything higher order).</p>
<p></p>
<p>One subtly I suppose is that at least in the first equation, $$\frac{y}{y'} = x$$, we can&#39;t have any solutions that have $$y' \equiv 0$$. So my broader advice is that when you solve one of these ODEs (after transforming into a FOLDE), is that you check whether your solutions are all valid based on the original ODE.</p>"

"Constant/Equilibrium Solutions: For separable DE&#39;s, why is it that we denote them with the equivalence sign &#34;≡&#34; instead  of &#34;=&#34;?","<p>My understanding is that this notation explicitly says &#34;y is the constant function $$\alpha$$&#34; instead of potentially implying that &#34;y is $$\alpha$$ for certain values of x&#34;. </p>

We can then integrate $$\frac{1}{x\ln(x)}$$ which equals $$\ln (\ln (x))$$ (choosing c = 0). By exponentiating this result, we get $$\mu (x) = \ln(x)$$, as obtained in the solution.</p>"

When to use integration factor?: I am kind of confused when I should use the integration factor and when I directly do the integration on both sides? Some separable DEs can be rearranged to look like the separable form y&#39; = f(x)g(y).,"If the equation is separable, go with integrating both sides because it’s usually easier.

"Practice Midterm 23W Short Answer 4: <p>Hello,</p>
<p></p>
<p>This question asks us to state the Riemann Sum of $$f(x) = sin(x)$$ for [0, $$\pi$$/2]. I understand what the formula should be and could state that. I&#39;m unsure of if they&#39;re looking for a calculated final value. If so, how would you go about calculating that, since you can&#39;t factor 1/n out the same way or apply the known formulas for sums of i since it&#39;s embedded in a trigonometric function?</p>

Indeed, the midterm from Winter 2022 was a timed (1 hour and 50 minute) online test. It was open-book and any online resource (outside of Chegg or other similar sites was allowed). As a result, it was probably a bit harder (in some sense) compared to the midterm from Winter 2023 (and the one you will be writing on Monday).

<p></p>
<p>then, to solve $$\int (csc^2x) dx$$, you could set it equal to $$\int \frac{1}{sin^2x} dx = \int \frac{sec^2x}{tan^2x} dx$$ dividing by $$cos^2x$$</p>

"When to check for constant solutions in differential equations?: For initial value problems, when do I know to check for constant solutions and how do I know whether they satisfy my initial condition?<div><br /></div><div>If it&#39;s not an initial value problem, do you still have to consider constant solutions?</div>","You need to check constant solutions whenever you divide by an expression involving $$y$$ while solving a DE. You need to make sure that that expression is not $$0$$. For example, if you solve the separable DE $$\frac{dy}{dx}=(y^2-1)x$$, your first step is to divide by $$y^2-1$$ -- but what if $$y^2-1=0$$, i.e, $$y\equiv 1$$ or $$y\equiv -1$$? You would need to check those functions separately. In the case of an IVP, if the constant function doesn&#39;t satisfy your initial condition, I suppose you can quickly rule it out as a potential solution.

<p>The formal definition of &#34;enclosed&#34; is defined as follows in <strong>Collins Dictionary:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>If a place or object is enclosed by something, the place or object is inside that thing or completely surrounded by it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(of a place) surrounded by a wall and covered.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Under our context, it should be (of an area) surrounded by functions and coverd.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider the Q5 in LA of the midterm, it stated that $$R$$ is denoted as the region enclosed by $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$ for $$x ∈ [0, 2]$$. </p>
<p>Thus, by defintion of enclosed according to <strong>Collins Dictionary:</strong>, if $$R$$ is enclosed by $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$, then $$R$$ is inside $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$ or completely surrounded by $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$. Furthermore, if according to <strong>Cambridge Dictionary:</strong> $$R$$ should be an area surrounded and coverd by $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$. For $$x ∈ [0, 2]$$, it is trivial that not entire $$x ∈ [0, 2]$$ satisfies the condition, only the sub-interval $$[0, 1]$$ satisfied. Therefore, $$R$$ is enclosed between $$f(x),  g(x), x = 0$$, and $$x = 1$$.</p>
<p>Also as Shonie pointed out; @614_f5; in that case, it’s obvious, clear, straightforward, and unambiguous.

<p>Great question! <br /><br />It sounds like you want to adopt the definition $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \, dx = \lim_{a\to\infty} \int_{-a}^a x \, dx \lim_{a\to\infty} \int_{-a}^0 x \, dx + \lim_{a\to\infty} \int_0^a x \, dx $$ and then this would give 0. Here are a couple of issues with this:<br /><br />First, $$\lim_{a\to\infty} \int_{-a}^a x \, dx = \lim_{a\to\infty} \int_{-a}^0 x \, dx + \lim_{a\to\infty} \int_0^{2a}  x \, dx = \infty$$ and this inconsistent with our previous answer.<br /><br />Another issue: let&#39;s do a change of variables where $$u=x+2$$, so $$du = dx$$ and $$x=u-2$$. The bounds are $$x=\pm \infty \implies u=\pm\infty$$, so we get </p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty x \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty u - 2 \, du = \int_{-\infty}^\infty u \, du - \int_{-\infty}^\infty 2 \, du = - \infty$$ and we get another inconsistent answer. <br /><br />Hence, it is standard to adopt the definition in the course notes for these types of improper integral.</p>"

"When to use divergence theorem: Hi I was wondering when it was appropriate to apply the divergence theorem? Would it be inappropriate to use it for series involving sines and cosines.

Of course, it will only give you information if $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} a_n$$ is non-zero or DNE
You can use divergence test on any series, including sines and cosines. An important thing to note is that just  because the limit of the sequence as n tends to infinity is 0, doesn&#39;t mean that the series itself is convergent.

"Geometric Series Formula: Hi I was wondering if the geometric series formula was either a/1-r or ar/1-r. Because I hear both, and unsure which one is correct. I tried using both in situations and have sometimes gotten the correct answer using ar/1-r. Sometimes I get the wrong answer with a/1-r ","<p>It depends, I suppose, on where the series starts. Assuming $$|r|<1$$, we have $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n=\frac{a}{1-r}$$; but if instead we start at $$n=1$$, we will end up with $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty ar^n=\frac{ar}{1-r}$$. I only remember the former. If the sum starts at some $$n\neq 0$$, reindex the sum to make it start at $$0$$.</p>

<p>In general, if the series is geometric and convergent, the sum is given by $$\frac{\text{first term}}{1-\text{common ratio}}$$, but you should show this carefully by re-indexing the sum.</p>"

<p>I would break this up into cases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, we should be able to easily show divergences for $$p<0$$ (e.g. if $$p=-1$$, then the series becomes $$\sum \ln n$$. Can you see what test to use here to show divergence?). Similar, for $$p=0$$, we should be able to show divergence relatively easily (we get $$\sum 1$$).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, for the cases where $$p>0$$, one avenue would be to use the comparison test. One thing to recall from MATH 137 is that $$\ln n < n$$ and that $$\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{(\ln n)^p}{n} = 0$$. The limit calculation implies that, for large enough $$n$$, we have $$(\ln n)^p < n$$.</p>"

Assume that $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}a_n$$ exists, and for contradiction, assume the limit is non-zero. This means that $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{a_n b_n}{b_n}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n$$ exists and is non-zero, so by the LCT, $$\sum a_nb_n$$ and $$\sum b_n$$ either both converge or both diverge.

"Riemann Rearrangement: Hi there, I know that Riemann Rearrangements are not tested but I just wanted to gain a better understanding of how they work. As of right now, I just can&#39;t wrap my head around the fact that adding 0s to a series changes the value of the resultant overall sum. Could someone explain?","<p>The rearrangement theorem says that if you take any conditionally convergent series, you can rearrange the terms to add up to any number you wish. One of the practice problems (week 8, practice problem 3) touches on this idea. In this problem, you show that if you take only the positive terms and add them up, the series diverges (to $$\infty$$). Similarly, if you take all the negative terms, that series would also diverge (to $$-\infty$$). </p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, suppose we have a target value we want to sum to, call it $$\alpha$$ and assume that $$\alpha>0$$ for simplicity. Since the positive terms add up to $$\infty$$, we can add as many as we need to reach a value slightly greater than $$\alpha$$. From there, we add some of the negative terms until our partial sum is below $$\alpha$$. Then, we go back to adding positive terms until we go above $$\alpha$$ and then add some negative terms until we&#39;re below $$\alpha$$, etc. Effectively, this process would mean that we oscillate around $$\alpha$$. <br /><br />For example, we can make the Alternating Harmonic Series, $$\sum (-1)^{n+1} \frac{1}{n}$$ add up to 1using the above described algorithm.

<p></p>
<p></p>","<p>1) the series always converges at the centre, which in more practical terms means that when $$x=a$$ the series looks like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$a_0(x-a)^0 + a_1(x-a)^1 + a_2(x-a)^2+ \ldots + a_n(x-a)^n$$ as $$n\to\infty$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Subbing in $$x=a$$ we get:</p>
<p>$$a_0(0)^0 + a_1(0)^1 + a_2(0)^2+ \ldots + a_n(0)^n$$ as $$n\to\infty$$</p>
<p>Then simplifying with the convention that $$0^0= 1$$:</p>
<p>$$a_0$$</p>
<p>^ this converges because it&#39;s just a single real number now, not an infinite sum. So the domain of convergence always contains the centre $$x=a$$ because we get a bunch of $$0's$$ and just end up with $$a_0$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the conventions, check out @879 </p>
<p></p>
<p>2) Yes it is an AST, but it&#39;s also a geo series, so we know the endpoints still diverge (essentially we&#39;d end up with $$\sum 1^n$$ and $$\sum (-1)^n$$ or similar and these both diverge). Doesn&#39;t hurt to check the endpoints if you&#39;re unsure though! </p>

"Realistic scenarios to apply Integral test?: <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was looking over my notes and had a question. Now that we have learned so many tests to see if a series converges (especially the ratio test and LCT), I was wondering under what circumstances do we realistically have to use the integral test?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A lot of times using it seems like more trouble than its worth, considering you have to prove the derivative is negative and then evaluate an improper integral.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Im sure it has uses but I am struggling to think of them and wanted to ask when we should apply the integral test. (Aside from the scenario when an antiderivative is super obvious)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>","<p>Integral test is a last-resort; I can&#39;t think of a series that can be integrated, where none of the other tests work, so unless a question states &#34;use integral test&#34;, you probably won&#39;t use it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The upside to checking all 402 conditions of the integral test is that if all the conditions are met, and the function can be integrated, the integral test <strong>will</strong> work. Another use of int test is the strength of the IFF that comes along with it, and inequalities that it forms, which can be used for proofs or approximations.</p>"

Therefore, we <strong>cannot</strong> use the ratio test to determine the radius.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead, they go through a comparison test by noticing that each $$|a_n| \leq 2$$ for all $$n$$. This means that they can compare $$\sum a_n x^n$$ with $$\sum 2 x^n$$. The latter series is just a geometric series and converges for $$|x|<1$$, so by comparison $$\sum a_n x^n$$ also converges for $$|x| <1$$.</p>"

<p>We only increase the index bc the <strong>first term before differentiation</strong> ($$n=1$$ in this example) is <em>usually </em>a constant, so if we were to differentiate a series such as $$e^x$$ five times, we would get the same series with five 0&#39;s at the start.

<p>I haven&#39;t solved this myself, but it looks like $$a$$ must be $$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1$$.

<p>I probably made a mistake while skimming through so I recommend writing out the first couple terms and differentiating, see what happens and let me know!</p>"

The new series is formed by replacing $$x$$ in the original series with $$x^2$$. Since the old series converged when $$|x|<R$$, the new series will converge when $$|x^2|<R$$, or equivalently, when $$|x|<\sqrt{R}.$$"

"WPP bonus: <md>I wonder if this is a valid proof to the bonus question by using induction. 

Prove that $$f^{(k)}(0) = 0$$.

The base case is $$f \in C^0(\mathbb {R}) = C(\mathbb {R}).$$

Suppose $$f \in C^k(\mathbb {R})$$, notice that there exists a polynomial $$p_{k+1}$$, such that $$f^{k+1} (x) = p_{k+1}  \frac{1}{x} e^{-\frac{1}{x^2}}$$. 

Therefore, $$\lim_{x \to 0} f^{k+1} (x) =  \lim_{x \to 0} p_{k+1}  (\frac{1}{x}) e^{-\frac{1}{x^2}}  = \lim_{x \to \infty} p_{k+1} (x) e^{-\frac{1}{x^2}} = 0$$

"Confused on how to find Taylor series and their use: <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I know this is a pretty basic question, but I have been reading the notes and going to class and im still kind of confused on how to find Taylor series, as well as their use. I apologize if a ton of my questions are covered in the notes, but I am just really lost and was hoping someone could explain this all a little more clearly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Where does a Taylor series differ from a power series when it comes to how they are defined? I understand that sometimes a power series will not represent a function across all $$\mathbb{R}$$, but what does that have to do with Taylor series? Why might we need to take one over another?</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. When calculating a Taylor series, do we just take the first few derivatives of our function and hope for a pattern? Or do we have a more concrete method? I saw that we can use a power series (which is easier to calculate) to somehow get the Taylor series, but how does that work?</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Does having a Taylor series mean a function is infinitely differentiable? What about for something like a polynomial which eventually will become 0 as you differentiate?</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Where does Taylor&#39;s theorem fit into all this? I know we reviewed it in class but I&#39;m not sure how something like the remainder theorem (where we bound the derivative with some M) relates to Taylor series.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>EDIT: I think to sum up a lot of my questions, where do a power series and a Taylor series differ?</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Again, sorry for all the questions, I know its a lot but I would really appreciate anyone helping me out here</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>","<md>Mcluarin series is a special Taylor series, Taylor series is a special power series, i.e. not all power series are Taylor series, and power series is a special infinite series.</md>
<p></p>
<p>A Taylor series is a special type of power series constructed from a function $$f(x)$$. While a power series has the form $$\sum a_n(x-a)^n$$ for some coefficients $$a_n$$, a Taylor series has the form $$\sum \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$$. That is, it&#39;s a power series where the coefficients are &#34;built&#34; from the function $$f$$ as $$a_n=\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You might be wondering, &#34;Why are these coefficients $$a_n=\frac{f^{(n)}{(a)}}{n!}$$ so special?&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The answer: If a function can be written as any sort of power series, say $$f(x)=\sum a_n(x-a)^n$$, then the $$a_n$$&#39;s <strong>must</strong> have the form $$\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}$$. We proved this by assuming we had a power series for $$f$$, then differentiating it over and over and plugging in $$x=a$$ after each differentiation to determine the coefficients. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This is actually really neat. For all we knew when we starting talking about series representations, maybe a function could be represented in various ways as a power series centred at some $$a$$. That is, maybe $$f(x)=\sum a_n(x-a)^n$$ and also $$f(x)=\sum b_n(x-a)^n$$ with $$a_n$$ different from $$b_n$$. Turns out, nope! There is <strong>at most one way</strong> to represent $$f$$ as a power series centred at $$a$$, and that way happens to be writing $$f$$ as a Taylor series, $$\sum\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n.$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>I say &#34;at most one&#34; in the paragraph above because not all functions can be represented by power series in the first place. The function needs to be continuous (this is Abel&#39;s Theorem). In fact, it needs to be differentiable. In fact, it needs to be <em>infinitely </em>differentiable. And even that isn&#39;t enough to guarantee a power series representation...</p>
<p></p>
<p>A couple weeks ago we learned that $$\frac{1}{1-x}$$ can be represented as a power series $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n$$ when $$|x|<1$$; then we learned that $$e^x$$ can be represented as a power series $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}$$ for <em>all</em> $$x$$. Last week we learned that if a function has uniformly bounded derivatives of all orders, then it too can be represented by a power series; hence we learned that $$\sin(x)$$ and $$\cos(x)$$ have power series representations, with $$\sin(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^nx^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$$ and $$\cos(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!}$$ for all $$x$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These are the big four examples. Another important one is the binomial series $$(1+x)^m=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\binom{m}{n}x^n$$, where $$m\in\mathbb{R}$$ and $$x\in(-1,1)$$. From these five examples, we can obtain power series representations for a variety of other functions using substitution, multiplication by a power of $$(x-a)$$, differentiation, and integration.</p>"

Consider the series $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty -f(n)$$. This series is continuous, positive, and decreasing, and since $$\int_1^\infty -f(x)\,dx$$ converges, it follows that $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty -f(n)$$ converges by the integral test. Now, multiply this series by $$-1$$. The resulting series still converges and is $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)$$.

"Order when manipulating series: <p>Hello</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am a little confused on what order to do steps when manipulating series. Say for example, I want to get the series representation of $$\int x^2sin(x)$$ (which is in the practice).</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could start by substituting $$x^2$$ into the series for $$sin(x)$$ and then multiplying by $$x^2$$, but I could also multiply the $$sin(x)$$ series by $$x^2$$ first and then substitute in $$x^2$$ into $$sin(x)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Depending on which way I go, I get a different answer in the series because the exponent of x will be different:<br /><br />(2n&#43;1 * 2) &#43; 2 = 4n&#43;4</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>(2n&#43;1 &#43; 2) * 2 = 4n&#43;6</p>
<p></p>
<p>Obviously there is only one answer, and the solutions use method one, but I don&#39;t get why the other method doesn&#39;t work? I figured order of steps didn&#39;t matter when manipulating a series.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was wondering if someone could explain. Again, I know method 2 is wrong, I am more curious as to why.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>","<p>Essentially we want to work from what we know to get to what we want. We know what the Taylor series of $$\sin(x)$$ looks like, and we have a rule about the composition of functions to sub in $$x^2$$ and get to $$\sin(x^2)$$, then we can multiply by $$x^2$$ to get $$x^2\sin(x^2)$$. This is method 1 as you suggested and works!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Method 2 is not correct, and I&#39;ll demonstrate why:</p>
<p></p>
<p>So our composition rule looks like this:</p>
<p><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flkqw8iusqnz5hk%2F5f24935715de28f1691f71b0e6f93127b91cf10c501f3d876416aadfcbe6816f%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.png"" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>That is, given $$f(x)$$, we can find the power series $$f(cx^m)$$ by following this rule. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So if we have $$f(x) = x^2\sin(x)$$, when we use this rule to sub in $$x^2$$ we are actually going to have $$f(x^2) = x^4\sin(x^2)$$, so this way is not super helpful for us! </p>
<p></p>
<p>Does that make more sense? A general process I would use is composition rule, then the multiplying by $$x^2$$ or whatever stuff, then integration / differentiation. Not sure where the adding power series rule would go into this order since I haven&#39;t used it very much.</p>"

<p>I am slightly confused on why we are reindexing the series to start from 1. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Would it be correct if I didn&#39;t reindex and just simplified straight away?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>","I think they&#39;re just reindexing to make the distinction that m choose n where n = 0 is defined as 1
Yes, the student answer is right. The coefficient is defined differently when n=0. We&#39;re not really reindexing here though, all we&#39;re doing is separating the n=0 term from the rest of the sum."

<p>Common things to look out for when you&#39;re trying to see whether an ODE is linear:</p>
<p>- trig stuff with $$y$$ (aka $$\cos(y)$$, $$\arcsin(y)$$, etc) </p>
<p>- power stuff with $$y$$ (aka $$e^y$$, $$2^{y'}$$, $$(\frac{4}{7})^{y'''}$$, etc)</p>
<p>- log stuff with $$y$$ (aka $$\ln(y)$$)</p>

<p>- multiplication/ division by $$y$$ (aka $$y\cdot y'$$, $$\frac{y'}{y}$$, etc, similar to the previous point)</p>

"Question about constant solutions in DEs: I get confused when solving types of DEs. The ones I generally encounter are FOLDEs, IVPs, and linear separable ones. But a FOLDE can be an IVP (which then means there exists a unique solution). In general, this course only covers first-order DEs, of which are usually separable and linear. <br /><br />1. I noticed when solving a FOLDE that is not an IVP, I the general solution is usually stated as &#34;y = ... OR y = y0&#34; where y0 is a constant solution. Is this why we state &#34;Assume y ≠ 0&#34; when solving for the general case, so we can divide by y?<br /><br />2. In the following example we have an initial condition, but I don&#39;t seem to intuitively understand what a &#34;constant solution&#34; means... so y(0)=2 means y is constantly 2 and therefore not 0??<br /><br />3. Also do we solve for the constant solution by setting up just g(y) = 0? if y&#39; = f(x)g(y)? What if the DE takes on a different form? or not separable?<br /><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flkqwclm3shhvy%2F73de5d23e78edef8e6930f5e57ee1a4a804a410f49ae41d8cc6f3ef7c2b91356%2FScreenshot_2024-04-13_at_6.02.40_PM.png"" alt=""Screenshot_2024-04-13_at_6.02.40_PM.pngNaN"" />","<p>1. I think you mean with separable equations right? I can&#39;t think of an example where a FOLDE has an equilibrium/constant solution (like $$y\equiv 0$$) but I might be forgetting. There is a funny substitution example from the W22 midterm but it is because we sub $$u=\frac{1}{y}$$ first that we have to check for $$y\equiv 0$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes, we case out $$y\equiv 0$$ so we can divide by $$y$$ and solve the ODE. After that, we still have to check whether $$y\equiv 0$$ is a solution though. Plug in 0 wherever you see a $$y$$, $$y'$$, or whatever and see if the resulting equation is true!</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Basically a constant solution (or equilibrium solution as I tend to say) is when $$y$$ just being a horizontal line solves our ODE. I think of them as &#34;boring&#34; solutions because they&#39;re usually pretty basic from what I&#39;ve seen. If you&#39;re doing something like dividing by $$y$$, as I mentioned before check $$y\equiv 0$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The exception to this is when we have an IVP. A differential equation has a whole giant family of solutions with an arbitrary constant ($$C$$ or $$A$$ as we usually put it). Our IC (initial condition) is telling us which family member it actually is. That is what an IVP is-- find the family, then find which member we want using the IC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So an IC would be like $$y(0)=2$$ as you showed. This is like $$f(0)=2$$. Whatever function we get as our solution, at $$x=0$$ $$f(x)=2$$. That is all they are saying! This helps us throw out the $$y\equiv 0$$ solution, since if $$f(x)=0$$ for all $$x$$ then $$f(0)\neq 2$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. I kinda addressed this in 1. already, but basically to check for the constant solution, turn all the $$y$$&#39;s into zeros and see if your equation is true. If it&#39;s true-- great! You found a constant solution. If it is false then throw out the $$y\equiv 0$$ because it does not work.</p>

"Estimating Error: <p>Hey I was just wondering what exactly we mean when we say we’re approximating the error of an integral to some value? All I see is that we’re really just taking all the terms before the series reaches some given value like here: </p>

<p><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flkqw8s0eq7i70x%2F468c00b108c83e6a96deb0f9fd84ed6ba3c06dca62880859b800aa39b72ce719%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.pngNaN"" /></p>","<p>Consider a power series which equals a function on some interval of convergence, for example some $$F(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n t^n$$ for all $$t \in (-1,1)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now for example let us consider the first 3 terms of our power series $$a_0 t^0 + a_1 t^1 + a_2 t^2$$, then we know that this is an approximation of our power series (since it is only the first 3 terms instead of all of them).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the case where our power series is an alternating series we can apply the last part of our alternating series test: </p>
<p><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkcasvx6i2f529%2Ffb7bf5a66a81da884f61bf98c1c01475f6df2fc8f787e073aabcca5e5e24a26b%2FScreenshot_2024-04-14_at_1.20.02_PM.png"" width=""532"" height=""326"" alt="""" /></p>

"Partial Decomposition vs Telescoping Series: From what I know from partial decomposition is that denominator can factorable, whereas for telescoping series, it is factored into consecutive series, right? For example, for 1/n(n&#43;1), can we use both partial decomposition and telescoping series. Can somebody help me clarify the telescoping series because I don&#39;t think I fully understand it?","<p>The idea is that partial fraction decomposition is a strategy used to write out a rational function in a different way. This new representation can be useful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We see this in integration, where we write out a complicated rational function as the addition of some more simpler rationals (which are easier to integrate)</p>
<p></p>
<p>When it comes to series, you may find that after performing a partial fraction decomposition, there is a pattern. Write out the first few terms of the series and you will see that some terms are cancelling out as the series continues towards infinity. This is a telescoping series: The terms are cancelling out, leaving only a few terms (usually near the beginning or end of the sum) untouched.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With those untouched terms you can now calculate the sum of the series for some finite series $$S_N$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As for your example $$\frac{1}{n(n+1)}$$, try a partial fraction decomposition on it! You will see that the result is $$\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}$$. Write out the first (and last) few terms and you will see that there is a lot of cancellation, leaving only a few terms which you can use to find the sum of the series.</p>"

<p>My solution was fundamentally the same as the answer, but arranged differently:</p>

<p></p>
<p>(Top is solution, bottom is mine, they are identical on desmos)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was able to rearrange mine to match the given solution, but it took some time and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be able to recognize that I could arrange it this way without seeing the solution. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I know the difference arose because I didn&#39;t flip some of the fractions they flip in the solution (like I solved $$A=\frac{1}{24}$$ instead of $$A=24$$ and other things)</p>
<p></p>
<p>My question is: is my form also acceptable? It&#39;s hard for me to recognize what the final/simplified answer should look like so if you have any tips on that I&#39;d also appreciate it</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks! </p>","Yes, either form is acceptable!"
Can ratio test yield 1 for an absolutely convergent series?: Can ratio test yield 1 for an absolutely convergent series?,"Consider $$\sum \frac{1}{n^2}$$. Recall that the ratio test gives no information when $$L=1$$ so the series could be absolutely convergent, conditionally convergent, or divergent! 
<p>No, that would never happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Edit: consider $$\sum \frac{1}{n^2}$$ actually! Recall that the ratio test gives no information when $$L=1$$ so the series could be absolutely convergent, conditionally convergent, or divergent! </p>
<p>No, that would never happen.</p>

No, that would never happen.
It the ratio test produces a limit of $$1$$, the series could converge conditionally, absolutely, or it could diverge -- we can&#39;t say anything. Examples: $$\sum \frac{(-1)^n}{n}$$, $$\sum \frac{1}{n^2}$$, $$\sum n$$ all have a limit of $$1$$ from the ratio test."
"Week FE 2b): <p>I didn&#39;t think we were allowed to divide a series by $$x$$ like this? </p>

<p>I thought Eric mentioned that this division wasn&#39;t allowed in office hours, because this property is only defined for $$m\in\mathbb{N}$$, but I might be misremembering. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Edit: maybe the division is allowed but we can&#39;t form the same conclusions about the $$R$$ and $$IOC$$ since this theorem doesn&#39;t apply?</p>","One issue is that if some of the coefficients in the beginning are non-zero, then you would get negative powers of $$x$$, i.e. the resulting function $$h(x)$$ would not be a power series. However, here since in the power series of $$\cos(x)-1$$ the coefficient $$a_0 = 0$$, we still obtain a power series in the end. In sum, yes you have to be careful with division and it does not always work.

"Taylor series equal to function: Will the piecewise function $$e^{\frac{-1}{x^2}}$$ for $$x\neq 0$$, $$0$$ for $$x=0$$ &#39;s Taylor series centred at x=0 be equal to its original function? By the way for this kind of piecewise function, we can only found its derivative by using the limit definition of derivative right? (I tried some derivatives and looks like the function&#39;s derivative still exists and bounded)",There&#39;s a question about this in one of the practice sets. The function is only equal to its Maclaurin series at the centre. The limit definition will be needed for the derivatives at $$0$$. The derivatives are not <em>uniformly</em> bounded on any interval.
