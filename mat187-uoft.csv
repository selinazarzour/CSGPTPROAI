<p>I just need clarification on why we take the absolute value of the numerator |x&#43;3|? Also, how to intuitively know when to take the absolute value?

<p></p>
<p>I leave full proof to you, but the outline is as follows. We define the principal square root of a number $$x\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$$ to be the number $$y\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$$ such that $$y^2=x$$, and we denote this $$\sqrt{x}$$. Normally we have that $$k^2=(k)(k)=(-k)(-k)$$ for any number $$k$$, but when we take the principal square root we only get back $$k$$, even if we originally had $$-k$$. This is the same effect as taking the absolute value.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I think this would be a question given to test knowledge of trig substitution. You have to look at the integral and the relationship between the terms, and think what trig relationships you know which have these same appearances. tan^2(x) &#43;1 = sec^2(x) comes to mind. Then make the substitution for x = tan(u) to make that relationship appear in the integral. Hopefully my own understanding is correct: </p>
<p>Edit: After reviewing the topic, there are three distinct patterns which you should be familiar with and one of these is sqrt(a^2&#43;x^2) as seen in this question. Based on which you are presented with, you should make a decision on which trig substitution to make (and each pattern consistently has its own trig ratio which is used). Like I said above, for a^2&#43;x^2 (here a =1), we are looking to make a substitution x=a*tan(theta) (this substitution is derived from Pythagorean triangle length relationships)</p>

If you try the second option you will see that the integral that you get is indeed more complicated than the one you started with, while the first option makes the integral simpler. Maybe not simple enough to solve yet. That means, you may need to apply IBP one more time to be able to solve it. "

Derivative of inverse trig functions: Are we expected to know how to differentiate inverse trigonometric functions?,"<p>did we not learn this last term…?</p>
<p></p>
<p>(From another student) Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions were in the MAT186 learning objectives, so they assume you already know them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you need a reminder, you calculate them as follows (I&#39;m only showing you the derivative of $$\arcsin$$, but the process is similar for the others):</p>
<p>$$\arcsin(x)=y\implies \sin(y)=x,\ x\in[-1,1]$$. Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to $$x$$ we have $$\cos(y)\frac{dy}{dx}=1\implies\frac{dy}{dx}=\sec(y)$$. Using a reference triangle, we find that $$\sec(y)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$$, so $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$$ for $$x\in[-1,1]$$.</p>

<p>from solution line 4-5, how did they evaluate the integral?<br /><br />Also, which trig integrals and derivatives are we expected to have memorized as just knowing cos, sin, and tan doesn&#39;t seem to be enough.<br /><br /><br /></p>","<p>They used the fact that $$\int\csc(\theta)\,d\theta=-\ln\left|\csc(\theta)-\cot(\theta)\right|+C$$ (<a href=""https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Primitive_of_Cosecant_Function/Cosecant_plus_Cotangent_Form"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a proof can be found here</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regarding how you find this result yourself, first start with the definition of an antiderivative. In this case, a function whose derivative equals $$\csc(x)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We start with the functions $$\csc$$ and $$\cot$$ because $$\frac{d}{dx}\csc(x)=-\csc(x)\cot(x)$$ and $$\frac{d}{dx}\cot(x)=-\csc^2(x)$$. These are not what we want, but they&#39;re close.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember that $$\frac{d}{dx}\ln\left|f(x)\right|=\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$$. So if we can find a function whose derivative contains itself, we can create it in our integral by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same expression.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let $$g(x)=\cot(x)+\csc(x)$$. So $$g'(x)=-\csc^2(x)-\csc(x)\cot(x)=-\csc(x)\left[\csc(x)+\cot(x)\right]=-\csc(x)g(x)$$. We&#39;ve found a function that satisfies the criteria in the previous paragraph. Moreover, $$g'(x)$$ contains $$csc(x)$$, so we don&#39;t need to manipulate the integral any further.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Using this function $$g(x)=\cot(x)+\csc(x)$$, we have that $$\int\csc(\theta)\,d\theta$$</p>
<p>$$\displaystyle=\int(-1)(-1)\csc(\theta)\frac{g(\theta)}{g(\theta)}\,d\theta$$</p>
<p>$$\displaystyle=\int\frac{\csc(\theta)\left[\csc(\theta)+\cot(\theta)\right]}{\csc(\theta)+\cot(\theta)}\,d\theta$$</p>
<p>$$\displaystyle=-\int\frac{-\csc\left[\csc(\theta)+\cot(\theta)\right]}{\csc(\theta)+\cot(\theta)}\,d\theta$$</p>
<p>$$\displaystyle=-\ln\left|\csc(\theta)+\cot(\theta)\right|+C$$</p>
They used the fact that $$\int\csc(\theta)=-\ln\left|\csc(\theta)-\cot(\theta)\right|+C$$ (<a href=""https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Primitive_of_Cosecant_Function/Cosecant_plus_Cotangent_Form"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">un preuve se trouve ici</a>)."

<p>I was wondering what exactly Q1 of the PCE was actually asking? I know exactly how to do PFD but am unsure; </p>
<p>Are we asking about what the general PFD setup would be similar to Q2? Or whether we would come across any of these terms at all? For example, if we tried to solve this question with A / [linear] and B / [linear] then we would eventually see an Ax term if we actually separated out all of the numerator to solve. We would also see a B term. But, if we simply chose E and D instead of A and B, then we would see the general PFD setup just with letters that are not the first and second of the alphabet. And having all of these options simultaneously would be nonsensical for one fraction (we need only two distinct letters). </p>

<p>When we construct the decomposed terms, we only know the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator (as otherwise we may perform polynomial division). In the case of quadratic denominators, all we can guarantee is that the numerator is at most a linear term.</p>
<p>We thus construct an arbitrary linear term with two coefficients, with the possiblility of the linear coefficient being zero should it turn out we only need the constant.</p>

<p>what does it mean by the least upper bound and how do we find it??</p>","Consider the function f(x)=sin(x). Clearly 2 is an upper bound for f(x), since f(x)&lt;=2 for all x. But it isn&#39;t a very good upper bound. The least upper bound on an interval is the smallest such constant M such that f(x)&lt;=M on that interval. So the least upper bound for sin(x) over the real numbers is 1.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!
Well we have N, b and a. It says least upper bound for second derivatives of function 3e^-(x/4), this is just a fancy way of saying the maximum the curve reaches on your interval."

<p><strong>2. are we supposed to use the acceleration graph to find which approximation method would be used on a corresponding velocity graph?</strong><br /><br /></p>
<p>The first method of thinking fits with the original v&#39;&#39; and v&#39;&#39;&#39; bounds given (since we&#39;d apply these to get an error bound for the area under the acceleration graph). However these bounds were updated to v&#39; and v&#39;&#39;, which aligns better with the second method.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the second line of thinking, here is an example: If the acceleration graph is &#43; and decreasing we would know the velocity graph is increasing and concave down.

<p>Let $$F(x)=\int_0^x |t|\,dt$$ (you can choose any real number for the lower limit, I use 0 because it&#39;s easier).</p>
<p><br />You&#39;re right that the area under the curve is always positive, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the primitive is similar. Remember that when $$x<0$$ the integral turns into $$-\int_x^0 f(t)\,dt$$. Since $$f(t)>0$$ for all $$t\in\mathbb{R}$$, the area is also positive, so $$-\int_x^0 f(t)\,dt < 0$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know that $$x^2\ge 0$$ for all $$x$$, so it&#39;s impossible for $$x^2$$ to be the primitive.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Démonstration (informel)</strong></p>
<p>Let $$F(x)=\int_0^x |t|\,dt$$ (I choose zero since it&#39;s easier, but any real number works).</p>
<p>If $$x\ge0$$, then $$\int_0^x t\,dt=\left.\frac{t^2}{2}\right\rvert_0^x=\frac{x^2}{2}$$. Otherwise if $$x<0$$ then $$\int_0^x -t\,dt=\left.-\frac{t^2}{2}\right\rvert_0^x=-\frac{x^2}{2}$$. It seems that</p>
<p>$$\displaystyle F(x)=\begin{cases} -\frac{x^2}{2} &x<0 \\ \phantom{-}\frac{x^2}{2} &x\ge 0. \end{cases}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>We prove this as follows.  Let $$x<0$$. Thus $$F(x)=-\frac{x^2}{2}\implies F'(x)=-x$$. Next let $$x>0$$. Thus $$F(x)=\frac{x^2}{2}\implies F'(x)=x$$. Finally let $$x=0$$. The function is defined differently on the left and right, so we must use the definition of the derivative:</p>
<p>$$\displaystyle\lim\limits_{h\to 0^-} \frac{F(0+h)-F(0)}{h} =\lim\limits_{h\to 0^-} \frac{-\frac{h^2}{2}-0}{h} =\lim\limits_{h\to 0^-} -\frac{h}{2}=0$$</p>
<p>$$\displaystyle\lim\limits_{h\to 0^+} \frac{F(0+h)-F(0)}{h} =\lim\limits_{h\to 0^+} \frac{\frac{h^2}{2}-0}{h} =\lim\limits_{h\to 0^+} \frac{h}{2}=0$$.</p>
<p>Thus $$\lim\limits_{h\to 0} \frac{F(0+h)-F(0)}{h}=0$$, and by definition $$F'(0)$$ exists and equals zero.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now we write $$F'$$ as a piecewise function (in the second case, when $$x=0$$ the expression evaluates to zero, so this is a valid description):</p>
<p>$$F'(x)=\begin{cases} -x & x<0 \\ x & x\ge 0. \end{cases}$$</p>
<p>But this is exactly the definition of absolute value, thus $$F'(x)=|x|$$, and by definition $$F$$ is an antiderivative of $$|x|$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Knowing $$F$$ is a primitive of $$|x|$$, now we show that $$F=\frac{x|x|}{2}$$. One can verify that $$F(x)=\frac{x}{2}\cdot g(x)$$, where $$g(x)=\begin{cases} -x &x<0 \\ \phantom{-}x &x\ge 0 \end{cases}$$. But $$g(x)=|x|$$ by definition, thus $$F(x)=\frac{x|x|}{2}$$. <em>QED</em></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Explication:</strong></p>
<p>Let $$F(x)=\int_0^x |t|\,dt$$ (you can choose any real number for the lower limit, I use 0 because it&#39;s easier).</p>
<p><br />You&#39;re right that the area under the curve is always positive, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the primitive is similar. Remember that when $$x<0$$ the integral turns into $$-\int_x^0 f(t)\,dt$$. Since $$f(t)>0$$ for all $$t\in\mathbb{R}$$, the area is also positive, so $$-\int_x^0 f(t)\,dt < 0$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know that $$x^2\ge 0$$ for all $$x$$, so it&#39;s impossible for $$x^2$$ to be the primitive.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Démonstration (informel)</strong></p>
<p>Soit $$F(x)=\int_0^x |t|\,dt$$ (je choisis zéro parce que c&#39;est plus facile, mais n&#39;importe quel réel marche).</p>
<p>Si $$x\ge0$$, on a $$\int_0^x t\,dt=\left.\frac{t^2}{2}\right\rvert_0^x=\frac{x^2}{2}$$. À part ça, si $$x<0$$ on a $$\int_0^x -t\,dt=\left.-\frac{t^2}{2}\right\rvert_0^x=-\frac{x^2}{2}$$. Il paraît que</p>
<p>$$\displaystyle F(x)=\begin{cases} -\frac{x^2}{2} &x<0 \\ \phantom{-}\frac{x^2}{2} &x\ge 0. \end{cases}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>On peut le démontrer comme suivant.  Soit $$x<0$$. Donc $$F(x)=-\frac{x^2}{2}\implies F'(x)=-x$$. Puis soit $$x>0$$. Donc $$F(x)=\frac{x^2}{2}\implies F'(x)=x$$. Finalement soit $$x=0$$. Le fonction est différente à la gauche et à la droite, donc on doit utiliser la définition de la dérivative:</p>
<p>$$\displaystyle\lim\limits_{h\to 0^-} \frac{F(0+h)-F(0)}{h}
=\lim\limits_{h\to 0^-} \frac{-\frac{h^2}{2}-0}{h}
=\lim\limits_{h\to 0^-} -\frac{h}{2}=0$$</p>
<p>$$\displaystyle\lim\limits_{h\to 0^+} \frac{F(0+h)-F(0)}{h}
=\lim\limits_{h\to 0^+} \frac{\frac{h^2}{2}-0}{h}
=\lim\limits_{h\to 0^+} \frac{h}{2}=0$$.</p>
<p>Donc $$\lim\limits_{h\to 0} \frac{F(0+h)-F(0)}{h}=0$$, et par définition la dérivée de $$F$$ existe et elle est égal à zéro à $$x=0$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maintenant on écrit $$F'$$ comme une fonction défini par morceaux (dans le deuxième cas, quand $$x=0$$ on a $$F'(x)=0$$, donc cette définition est valide):</p>
<p>$$F'(x)=\begin{cases}
-x & x<0 \\
x & x\ge 0.
\end{cases}$$</p>
<p>Mais cela est exactement la définition de la valeur absolue, donc $$F'(x)=|x|$$, et par définition $$F$$ est une primitive de $$|x|$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Connaissant que $$F$$ est une primitive, maintenant on démontre que $$F=\frac{x|x|}{2}$$. On peux vérifier que $$F(x)=\frac{x}{2}\cdot g(x)$$, où $$g(x)=\begin{cases} -x &x<0 \\ \phantom{-}x &x\ge 0. \end{cases}$$ Mais $$g(x)=|x|$$ par la définition, donc $$F(x)=\frac{x|x|}{2}$$. <em>QED</em></p>
<p>(Note: primitive is another word for antiderivative, for some reason my translator plugin prefers it)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let $$f(x)=|x|$$ and $$F(x)=\int_0^x f(t)\,dt$$ (you can choose any real number for the lower limit, I use 0 because it&#39;s easier).</p>
<p></p>
<p><br />You&#39;re right that the area under the curve is always positive, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the primitive is similar.

<p>We know that $$x^2\ge 0$$ for all $$x$$, so it&#39;s impossible for $$x^2$$ to be the primitive.</p>

"WH1 Question 3: For question 3 on the Written Homework 1 assignment, I understand that in order to determine whether an integral diverges or converges, you must observe the limit of the definite integral after finding the antiderivative. However, the function/integrand given in the question seems somewhat “impossible” (not sure if it is or if I’m doing something wrong with my calculations) to integrate. If possible, may I receive some guidance on how to approach this question? I’ve tried methods of such as IBP, PFD and Substitution. Is there even a way to determine the divergent or convergent nature of an integral without actually finding the antiderivative (and by this, I mean if it’s possible to use the integrand to determine its behaviour)?","One way to determine divergence/convergence is by comparing with a known integral like 1/x or 1/x^2 . You may wish to check out Theorem 3.7 in Chapter 3.7 of the OpenStax textbook for more information. 
You can use the comparison theorem for this problem!"
"written homework question 2a: Hello! For question 2a from the written homework, is it asking us to find an upper bound that it as close to the exact value as possible?

Divergence/Convergence: Hello! I was wondering what is the sum of two divergent integrals? What about the sum of convergent and divergent integral?,"<p>From what I remember from High School</p>
<p>if you can prove at least one of the integrals in a sum of integrals is divergent, the sum must also be divergent (which makes sense).

"Regarding the Error bound formula: <p>I was reviewing last need&#39;s lecture notes and I was confused about the formula for the error bound. Does “M” need to be PRECISELY the maximum of f’(x) / f”(x) on the given interval? Or can it be just an upper bound value?</p>
<p></p>","<p>It&#39;s possible to use an upper limit other than the exact maximum, but it gives you a less strict limit for the error.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<p>Let $$f:\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}$$ be differentiable on $$[a,b]$$, and $$L_n$$ a left-handed Riemann sum of $$f$$ with $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$ subintervals. So $$\left|\int_a^b f(x)\,dx - L_n\right| \le \frac{M(b-a)^2}{2n}$$ where $$M=\max\limits_{a\le x\le b} |f'(x)|$$. [A4]</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let $$U\ne M$$ be an upper bound of $$f$$. Since $$M$$ is the supremum, it follows that $$U>M$$. Then $$\frac{M(b-a)^2}{2n} < \frac{U(b-a)^2}{2n}$$. So $$\left|\int_a^b f(x)\,dx - L_n\right| < \frac{U(b-a)^2}{2n}$$.</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible to use an upper limit other than the exact maximum, but it gives you a less strict limit for the error.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Demonstration:</p>
<p><br />Let $$f:\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}$$ be differentiable on $$[a,b]$$, and $$L_n$$ a left-handed Riemann sum of $$f$$ with $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$ subintervals. So $$\left|\int_a^b f(x)\,dx - L_n\right| \le \frac{M(b-a)^2}{2n}$$ where $$M=\max\limits_{a\le x\le b} |f'(x)|$$.</p>

<p></p>
Note that you are computing an upper bound, and not the exact value of the integral. If your M is exactly the maximum, then you are achieving the best bound that the given formula allows you to achieve. If your M is greater than the maximum, you are still getting an upper bound.

How would you estimate the  maximum value on a function: If you were to be given a functions such as 2x(e^-x2) on an interval of -10 to 10 how would you estimate the maxiumum absolute value of this function to use in the error bound formula.,"<p>Assuming your equation is $$\left|2x\exp(-x^2)\right|$$, you can find the true maximum value (in terms of $$e$$) using the optimization process [1] (calculate the derivative, find its zeros, evaluate the function at the zeros).</p>
<p></p>
<p>For an estimate, you can use the following facts:</p>
<ol><li>$$\left|2x\exp(-x^2)\right|$$ is an even function</li><li>$$\exp(-x^2)$$ decreases faster than $$x$$ increases [2].</li><li>The maximum value of $$\exp(-x^2)$$ is $$1$$.</li></ol>
<p>We can therefore conclude that $$\left|2x\exp(-x^2)\right| \le 2(1) = 2$$ (the true maximum is about 0.858).</p>
<p></p>
<p>[1] Calculation of maximum value (even function so we only take $$x>0$$):</p>
<p>$$\frac{d}{dx}2x\exp(-x^2) = 2\exp(-x^2)-4x²\exp(-x^2)=2\exp(-x^2)\left[1-2x^2\right]=2\exp(-x^2)\left[1-x\sqrt{2}\right]\left[1+x\sqrt{2}\right]$$.</p>
<p>So there are critical points at $$x=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$, but we ignore the negative one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Evaluating at critical and end points:</p>
<p>$$f(10) = 2(10)\exp(-10^2) = \frac{20}{e^{100}}$$</p>
<p>$$f(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) = 2\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{1^2}{\sqrt{2}^2}\right)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{e}}$$</p>
<p>So maximum is $$\sqrt{\frac{2}{e}}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[2] Formally, $$\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} x\exp(-x^2) = \lim\limits_{x\to\infty} \frac{x}{\exp(x^2)}=\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} \frac{1}{2x\exp(x^2)}$$ by the Hospital&#39;s rule; the previous equals 0 so $$\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} x\exp(-x^2)=0$$.</p>

"Homework 1 Question 3 Part A: <p>For the question asking whether it converges or diverges, observing the function as it approaches -inf and inf, we can obviously take the limit to see what the limit will result in. However, in terms of integrals, a random function such as limit approaching infinity of (5/(1&#43;x^2 e^x) will collapse to 0, but and we can tell that the integral will eventually converge since the denominator is so large. With our current knowledge, however, it is impossible for us to integrate that by hand. Would it be enough to say the integral will eventually converge due to the incredibly rapid pace that the denominator is growing at? Is there any way to prove this statement because I cannot think of any other way to say this, other than the fact that we just know it will.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, for a limit such as limit approaching inf of x^2 e^-x, would we also be allowed to state that the limit is also approaching 0, as we know that the exponential function will grow much faster than x^2? I did use L Hopital&#39;s to prove it, but I was also wondering if we could also just state that since we know e^x will grow much faster, itll eventually approach 0.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you</p>","<p>The statement that the integral converges because the denominator increases very quickly is not a valid mathematical argument -- you don&#39;t explain what &#34;speed&#34; is sufficient for convergence (for example, why does $$\frac{1}{x}$$ diverge but $$\frac{1}{x^{1.01}}$$ converge?), and you don&#39;t explain what you mean by &#34;speed&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You must use the comparison theorem for this argument. With the $$\frac{1}{1+x^2e^x}$$ example, you can use $$2e^{-x}$$ for the upper limit (I&#39;ll leave the proof to you). Since $$\int_0^\infty 2e^{-x}$$ is convergent, you know that $$\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+x^2e^x}$$ is too.</p>

The definite integral of the product of two functions is the area under the product, which is NOT equal to the product of teh integral under each curve.  The best way to think about the integral of a product is either through the substitution rule or the integration by part rule. In both cases, you will be modifying teh integral into a different one in the hope that you can directly visualize the latter integral.

If you consider two functions, $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$, defined on interval $$[a, b]$$, then the integral of the product $$f(x). g(x)$$ from $$a$$ to $$b$$, represents the signed area between the curves of $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$!

"HW1-1b: I have the equation of the blue circle and the equation of the red lines, I need to find the intersection. But the answer I got is so complicated. How should I do?",You can use geometry to find the intersection. You only need to use calculus/integration for when the areas come into play. If you search around on the Pizza there are already quite a few posts on this question.
"HW1 - Need some feedback on this!: <p>Hey just looking for some feedback on my analysis thus far, I have been told prior that taking the derivative and setting equal to 0 gives you M. But I don&#39;t think its that applicable here since we don&#39;t know what A, B  etc,. are, I went for a more analytical approach. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If I used Mn for the first interval [0, A] (hypothetically), the upper bound formula is missing the M:</p>
<p>$$\int_{0}^{A}v(t)dt-M_{n}=\frac{M(b-a)^3}{24n^2}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>The M here would be given by |v&#39;&#39;(t)| on the interval [0, A]. My question is, can we analyze the a(t) = v&#39;(t) graph&#39;s tangents on the interval [0, A] to determine when the max will occur? Then sub in that value for t in the provided |v&#39;&#39;(t)| upper bound equation. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Similarly, on the interval [A, B], analyzing the tangents you can determine that at point A and B have maxes. Hence max[A,B] will occur at t=A,B? </p>
<p></p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if this is the right approach, and I&#39;m having a hard time applying numbers to this part. </p>
<p></p>","<p>I think you are trying to find the exact maximum of the derivative. Note that it is not at all necessary that M is the maximum. There is no such thing as &#34;<strong>THE</strong> M&#34;. There are many possible and correct Ms that bound a derivative.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, if $$f''(x)=\sin(x)$$ you could actually take $$M=2$$ if you wanted. It just needs to be a reasonably upper bound on the second derivative.</p>

"Proving that a function is always greater (HW1 Problem 3): <p>Hi, I am working on question 3 a) from the written homework.

<p>I have picked a function that is greater than the original function by using desmos to visually compare the two. But how can I mathematically prove that my chosen function is greater than the actual function?</p>","<p>Let&#39;s say you want to show that</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\frac{1}{x^2+\sin(x)+1}\leq\frac{1}{x^2}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>When trying to show this, you first need to consider why this is the case, i.e. rather than trying to push it around, what - from looking at it - make this inequality true.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this case, for example, one could say that this is true because $$\sin(x)+1$$ is only making the denominator larger (we are adding something positive), so we divide by more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So what we are using here is $$\sin(x)\geq -1$$. That is what makes the original inequality true. Now you can start with $$\sin(x)\geq -1$$ and manipulate it until you get to the original inequality $$\frac{1}{x^2+\sin(x)+1}\leq\frac{1}{x^2}$$.</p>

<p>Integration requires the function to be continuous on the integration interval (here $$[1,\infty)$$), but $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{|x-3|}}$$ is discontinuous at $$x=3\in[1,\infty)$$. So we have to split the integral in two around $$x=3$$.</p>

"Mathematical Logic Puzzle: <p>This is far outside the scope of the course, but it is math-related so I post it here regardless. I have been stumped by a math puzzle in my analysis book for the last few months, so I put it to the class to see if anyone has ideas. The problem is as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let $$W$$ be a property that is satisfied by certain subsets of $$\mathbb{R}$$. Given $$X\subseteq\mathbb{R}$$, we say $$X$$ is $$W$$ iff it satisfies property $$W$$, and we say it is $$\overline{W}$$ iff $$\mathbb{R}-X$$ is $$W$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now suppose we know that given an arbitrary number of $$\overline{W}$$ sets, the union of all of them is also $$\overline{W}$$. What conditions must the property $$W$$ satisfy (in other words, what are some necessary conditions for $$W$$?)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hint: Below we list examples of conditions that satisfy the requirement on $$W$$:</p>
<ol><li>The set is finite.</li><li>The set has less than eight elements.</li><li>The set contains only integers.</li></ol>
<p>We now list examples of conditions that do not satisfy the requirement on $$W$$:</p>
<ol><li>The set contains exactly eight elements.</li><li>The set contains an even number of elements (and is hence finite).</li></ol>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>One of my first ideas was that the property must not bound the cardinality below, but this is disproven by the property &#34;The set contains only the number 1.&#34; This turns out to be a valid choice of $$W$$ since only a single set is $$\overline{W}$$, hence the union of an arbitrary collection of $$\overline{W}$$ sets is also $$\overline{W}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another idea I considered was that the intersection of all $$\overline{W}$$ sets must be the empty set, but the above property disproves that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas/methods to approach this?</p>","This is a really interesting puzzle! I do feel that it&#39;s quite tricky to give a very generic answer to this. This does, however, smell a lot like the definition of open and closed sets in topology. (W is closed iff it&#39;s complement is open etc.)"

"How to determine most accurate approximation: I&#39;ve noticed from lectures, as well as the written homework, that I have trouble determining the most accurate approximation method given a graph. Does it require memorization of certain rules (ie when trapezoidal is better or worse than midpoint), or is there a trick I can use to understand the reasoning behind the accuracy of each method (without having to derive it every time)? I understand the basics (ie. when left- and right-point Riemann sums are overestimate vs underestimate), and when I read the PCE&#39;s, I understood the reasoning, but when it comes to determining a situation on my own, I get very confused and don&#39;t know how to decide, especially if it&#39;s between trapezoidal vs midpoint.

<p>- trapezoid =&gt; concave up</p>
<p>- left endpoint =&gt; decreasing</p>
<p>- right endpoint=&gt; increasing</p>
<p></p>
<p>(flip for underestimations)</p>
<p></p>
<p>generally you should prefer the first two to the latter two as their error bound is proportional to $$\frac{1}{n^2}$$ rather than $$\frac{1}{n}$$. however there are certain cases where a function is both concave up and down so it is unclear which of the first two to use, in which case you might want to pick a left/right endpoint. as a special case you should use trapezoidal for linear functions since it matches exactly.</p>

I&#39;m too lazy to understand fully why it&#39;s not going to be &#34;unsolvable&#34; if the rates aren&#39;t equal, but my guess is that the contents of the tank aren&#39;t constant, meaning that it&#39;ll just be that much more complex to set it up.

"Domain restrictions: <p>Hello, I am confused on how we determined the interval of validity for ODEs during today&#39;s lecture.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Plugging t = -5/2 back into the actual original ODE also doesn&#39;t cause any issues, so could we undo this restriction at the end and say t can be -5/2?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any answers on this.</p>","<p>My understanding of the first example is that we said that based on putting it in standard form, we actually altered the ODE.

Can someone show the specific steps to solve this problem?<br /><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flm7556m6cl45bd%2F3bdb9de50bfb08dc6b65d5ef1db7268a9b6721bae60966d40ba86bfb959ec9f5%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.pngNaN"" />","<p>You first realize that this is a &#34;separable ODE&#34; because we can write $$\frac{dP}{dt} = 1P(1-P)$$. Rearranging, you get $$\frac{dP}{P(1-P)}=dt$$ (on suppose que $$P\ne 0,1$$). Integrate both sides, you get $$\int\frac{1}{P(1-P)}\,dP=\int1\,dt$$. Using partial fraction decomposition, you can compute $$\ln|P|-\ln|1-P|=t+C$$, hence $$|\frac{P}{1-P}|=e^{t+C}=e^te^C$$. Let $$C_1=e^C$$, then $$|\frac{P}{1-P}|=C_1e^t$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we remove the absolute value operation, there are two branches and we write $$\frac{P}{1-P}=\pm C_1e^t$$. Note that the only difference between the two is the sign, and this can be combined with the multiplicative constant, so we can write $$\frac{P}{1-P}=C_2e^t$$. Since $$P\ne1$$, we have $$P=C_2e^t - C_2Pe^t$$, so $$P=\frac{C_2e^t}{1+C_2e^t}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the IVP, we assume that $$P(0)=P_0\ge0$$. There are two potential problem values $$P_0=0$$ and $$P_0=1$$. For now, we simply evaluate $$P(t)=\frac{C_2e^t}{1+C_2e^t}$$ à $$t=0$$. We have $$P_0=\frac{C_2e^0}{1+C_2e^0}$$, then $$P_0=\frac{C_2}{1+C_2}$$, then $$P_0+C_2P_0=C_2$$. Thus $$C_2=\frac{P_0}{1-P_0}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now we check that this works for $$P_0=0$$. If it does, we have $$C_2=0$$, $$P(t)$$ becomes $$P(t)=0$$. This function satisfies the differential equation, so this solution works for $$P_0=0$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But we&#39;re not so lucky with $$P_0=1$$ because our expression for $$C_2$$ isn&#39;t defined there. But note that $$\frac{dP}{dt}$$ is constant when $$P(t)=1$$, so we can define $$P(t)=1$$ when $$P_0=1$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This gives us a piecewise function dependant on the value of $$P_0$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You first realize that this is a &#34;separable ODE&#34;. g(y) = P(1-P) and f(t) = 1. This means that dP/dt = P(1-P)*1. Rearranging, you&#39;ll get dP/(P(1-P)) = dt. Integrate both sides, you&#39;ll get integral of 1/(P(1-P)) (respect to P) is equal to integral of 1 (respect to dt). Partial decomposition, and you&#39;ll get ln|P|-ln|1-P| = t&#43;C. |P/(1-P)| = e^(t&#43;C). We assume that C&gt;0, so then we can get the coefficient C1 (e^C). Now because e^t*positive constant is always positive, then there&#39;s no need for the absolute values anymore. P/(1-P) = C1e^t.</p>
<p>P = C1e^t * (1-P). Distributing and rearranging, we&#39;ll get P = C1e^t/(1&#43;C1e^t). We assumed C1 does not equal 0 as we carried out these last few steps, because e^anything cannot equal 0. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure of why we assume C&gt;0. I outlined my guess, but I would like an instructor to clarify. </p>"

<p></p>
<p>For equations where one of the unknown values is a function, does the same idea hold? That is, given a function and a variable, is the set of solutions equal to some subset of $$\mathbb{R}\times(\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R})$$ (tuple of numbers and functions)? If this is the case, then are there any requirements on the function for how many numbers pair with it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>As an example, consider the equation $$xf(x)=1$$, where $$x\in\mathbb{R}$$ and $$f:\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}$$ is a function. Assuming $$x\ne0$$ we have $$f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$$. So a subset of the solution set is $$\left\{ (x,\frac{1}{x}):x\in\mathbb{R}^* \right\}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, notice that this equation also holds for $$f(x)=1$$ if we only consider the domain to be $$\{1\}$$. In fact, we have that $$x\cdot x^{2n}=1$$ for all $$n\in\mathbb{Z}$$ when $$x=1$$, and that $$x\cdot x^{2n+1}=1$$ for all $$n\in\mathbb{Z}$$ when $$x\in\{-1,1\}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do we still consider these functions to be valid components to a solution (i.e. the function component of the pair) despite the extremely restricted domain? What about in the case of a differential equation?</p>","<md>It depends on the question. For functional equations, the domain and co-domain of the function are always specified. For example, the functional equation below asks for a function that is $$(0,\infty)\mapsto(0,\infty)$$:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afh0UDifNXg
Without the domain and codomain restrictions, one can easily see that the function $$f:\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}; f(x)=0$$ satisfies the equation, however this function does not comply with the restrictions imposed on $$f$$ by the question, and thus would not be considered a valid solution.</md>

"Regarding logistics equations: I am currently trying to complete WebWork4 at the moment, and I am quite stumped on the part about logistic equations. Will this be covered in the B4 lecture? ","<p>I can&#39;t talk about lecture content, but for your question about logistic functions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>For any logistic function $$P(t)$$ we have $$\frac{dP}{dt}=-k(P-m_n)(P-m_x)$$, where $$k$$ is the proportionality factor, $$m_n$$ is the minimum value, and $$m_x$$ is the maximum value.</p>
In its most simple form, the logistic equation is $$y'=y(1-y)$$. This is a separable ODE that is mainly known for modeling populations. You should have seen a variation of this in MAT186, as well as in our lectures in B1 or B2. "

<p></p>
<p>the differential logistic equation is provided as $$\frac{dP}{dt}=rP(1-\frac{P}{K})$$ where $$K$$ is the upper limit and $$r$$ is the growth rate. you can tell this works because there are two clear equilibrium solutions at $$P=0$$ and $$P=K$$ which give you the asymptotes of a logistic function. $$r$$ also scales the &#34;aggressiveness&#34; of the slope of the function. you may also replace the first equilibrium solution determined by $$P$$ with $$(1-\frac{P}{k})$$ if you need a different lower limit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>the integration of this function is also given in the openstax chapter which you can probably figure out yourself.</p>

<p>In this question, I am getting the answer as t = (-19)/(20k) after having solved it multiple times. This would only be valid if k is a negative constant of proportionality. Hence, is that the case here, or is the answer different?</p>","<p>This question is a bit odd because it uses the word &#34;speed&#34; (scalar speed) instead of &#34;velocity&#34; (vector speed); assuming it&#39;s not a mistake we have that $$\left|\frac{dy}{dt}\right|=ky^2$$ rather than $$\frac{dy}{dt}=ky^2$$. If it&#39;s actually a mistake and they meant vector speed, the value of $$k$$ could be negative (meaning the speed vector is in the $$-\hat{j}$$ direction), but for my answer I&#39;ll assume the use of &#34;speed&#34; is intentional.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From $$\left|\frac{dy}{dt}\right|=ky^2$$ we deduce that $$k\ge 0$$ because $$y^2\ge 0$$ and the expression on the right must be positive. From here there are two possibilities: (1) $$\frac{dy}{dt}=-ky^2$$ or (2) $$\frac{dy}{dt}=ky^2$$. Integrating the two we have (1) $$y=\frac{1}{kt+C_1}$$ and (2) $$y=-\frac{1}{kt+C_2}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know that $$y(0)=20$$, so we calculate $$C_1=\frac{1}{20}$$ and $$C_2=-\frac{1}{20}$$. So we have (1) $$y=-\frac{20}{20kt+1}$$ and (2) $$y=-\frac{20}{20kt-1}=\frac{20}{1-20kt}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Solving for $$t$$ when $$y=1$$:</p>
<p>(1) $$1=\frac{20}{20kt+1} \implies 20kt=19 \implies t=\frac{19}{20k}$$.</p>
<p>(2) $$1=\frac{20}{1-20kt} \implies -19=20kt \implies t=-\frac{19}{20k}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since $$t\ge 0$$ by convention we know that the second equation is impossible, so we have $$t=\frac{19}{20k}$$. (Intuitively we know the velocity should be negative since the plane is descending, so $$-ky^2$$ makes more sense.)</p>"

<p>I came to this ODE here: </p>
<p>$$2(\frac{F}{m}x+C)=v(x)^2$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>After solving v(0) = V as the question asks in Part (3). I am struggling to conclude how we can show velocity decreases with x:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$2(\frac{F}{m}x+\frac{V^2}{2})=v^2$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>My only sound reasoning is that F is acting in the opposite direction to V, and therefore should be negative hence multiplying by x would result in a subtraction from the initial velocity which over distance (x increases) the current velocity of the rocket decreases. But continuing with this equation results in negative answers for what should be positive like in Part (4) (granted, I could make the same argument stating F is acting in the opposite direction and should be negative, but I am unsure). </p>

You can eliminate $$F$$ from your equation from the start.  Your ODE becomes $$-G\frac{Mm}{x+R}^2=mx''(t)$$. As the question guides you here you will need a change of variable and then solving your PDE using a separable method. At this point the initial value allows you to find a specific solution which does decrease as $$x$$ increase.

Let's say I have some rectangle in a 2D plane. If I cut it up into very small rectangles, then I can sum up those rectangles to recover the original area. Now notice that I can achieve the same result if I instead cut up very small triangles (or just a different shape) and integrate it all back together.

In later engineering applications, you might find that this way of thinking is useful for instance if you have some small volume $$\mathrm dV$$ and you instead want to express it as a small length times a small area $$\mathrm dl\mathrm dA$$ so you can write something similar to

$$\int\mathrm dV = \int\mathrm dl\mathrm dA$$

and make the problem on the left easier to solve.

This can pose a challenge when we move into complex functions because now I have some function that potentially returns infinitely many values for a given input. To remedy this, we say that our arguments (the $$\theta$$ variable) has to be inside some interval of length $$2\pi$$ and here we've picked a fairly standard choice of $$(-\pi;\pi]$$ (can you see why one of the ends is open and the other is closed?). 

Now our functions can return infinitely many outputs but we only choose the one that lies in the agreed interval and say that we only consider ""the principal argument"".

<p>This is a very good question. Indeed understanding 1) why you need to do this  AND 2) how to do this are both among the learning objectives of this course and the other first-year math courses. Your tutorial and HW feedback are designed to help you see where you can improve this skill.  A major difference between mathematical expectations in high school and university lies in communication skills. <br /><br />Math communication is an important skill for you as a future engineer. As an engineer, you will work as a part of a group and will apply your mathematical knowledge to various applied contexts. However, not everyone in yoru group has the same background knowledge as you do. Imagine yourself pitching a solution to various admin and management levels of your company. It is not enough to say I have the correct final answer. Your report should convince your reader (who may have little math knowledge) that you know what you are doing. Writing so that someone who knows the problem agrees that you had the correct idea is not the goal here. Your writing should be in such a way that it leaves no room for doubting your idea. It should be bulletproof.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is not the skill you gain in one tutorial HW, or even one course. This a continuous multi-year process. however, it is important to realize that this si the goal you are moving towards. <br /><br />As for specifics of being able to realize where and exactly what needed more explanation and why I encourage you to read the provided solution and compare your 1) writing style and 2 ) your reasoning with the solution. Some questions that you can ask yourself: is my answer formulated in full and sense-making sentences? is every step and idea I used justified? Did I clearly state every assumption I made and why I had to make it. </p>

<p>&gt; Part (A): My ODE for T1&#39; is in terms of both T2(t) and T1(t), and it is simply flipped for T2&#39;. Is this okay? In other words, can I write the ODE of this in terms of both T1 and T2? </p>
<p>I do this because for the rate out you need T1, and for the rate in you need T2 unless I am misunderstanding this question</p>
<p></p>
<p>&gt; Part (B): The follow up to this is that in this part, I cannot seem to eliminate t at all or rewrite it in terms of T1. </p>
<p>I was able to rewrite T2 in terms of T1 due to the nature of the setup and initial salt content. But eliminating t has me stumped (is it even possible?). </p>",This has been resolved in the comments.

"WH2 Question 1 (5): <p>I&#39;m a little confused on how to evaluate the integration constant because I have 2 different ideas of what the initial condition might be.</p>

However, this was the initial speed as the rocket travelled upwards, so I&#39;m unsure of its validity since we&#39;re measuring the rocket&#39;s journey downwards now.</p>
<p>2. or should the initial velocity of the rocket&#39;s path downwards be assumed to be V(xmax), because at Xmax the velocity is 0, before the rocket begins its descent downwards</p>
<p></p>
<p>Any tips would be much appreciated!</p>","I was a bit confused about this as well. If I have the wrong idea, someone please correct me, but I&#39;ll explain what I did. To re-evaluate the integration constant, we must flip the integral by setting a new initial x-value (hint: you already have this value). Using that, we can re-solve for the integration constant and use that to find the final speed of the rocket. Essentially, you must prove that your assumption for the final speed is correct. "

"Reevaluating a constant of integration: Hello all,<br /><br />I have encountered this problem time after time after time and I think we should clarify this: when is it ok to reevaluate a constant of integration if it&#39;s just a bunch of constants bunndled together? Is it always ok when we just have constants?","<md>Good question, we often reuse C as a constant to mean ""some constant is needed here"" instead of defining $$C_1, C_2, C_3, \dots$$ which can get tedious and doesn't let us see the core idea of the solution. 

An example you've likely seen many times would go as follows

$$\int\frac{\mathrm dy}{y} = \int t\mathrm dt$$

$$\ln(y) = t + C$$

$$y = Ce^t$$

Now I'll write it out in full and you'll see the difference:

$$\int\frac{\mathrm dy}{y} = \int t\mathrm dt$$

$$\ln(y) + C_1 = t + C_2$$

let $$C_3 = C_2 - C_1$$ then $$\ln(y) = t + C_3$$

$$y = e^{t+C_3} = e^t\cdot e^{C_3}$$

finally let $$C_4 = e^{C_3}$$ then $$y = C_4e^t$$

The fact that I've defined 4 constants doesn't make my solution any better and it's harder to follow for someone reading through. Hence why we can (1) define a constant of integration for one of integral (2) redefine said constant from an additive one to a scaling one by the laws of exponents and (3) write $$C = C_1\cdot C$$ = $$C = C + C_1$$ to shorten notation.

And to your second point - yes, this only works if you have arbitrary constants.</md>"

Practice question: 2020 Term Test 1: How would I approach this question? Instinctually I feel like it converges since 1/root(x) and root(10-x) both converge but how should I show this? Should I take apart the integral and analyze the limits separately? If two of the parts converge and e^(cosx) diverges does the integral it converge?,"First note that $$\frac{1}{e}\le e^{\cos(x)}\le e$$ since $$-1\le\cos(x)\le 1$$, so we know that $$\frac{\sqrt{10-x}}{\sqrt{x}}e^{\cos(x)}e\le \frac{\sqrt{10-x}}{\sqrt{x}}e$$. Also, we know that the maximum value of $$\sqrt{10-x}$$ on $$[0,10]$$ equals $$\sqrt{10}$$, so $$\frac{\sqrt{10-x}}{\sqrt{x}}e\le\frac{e\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt{x}}$$.
First note that $$\frac{1}{e}\le e^{\cos(x)}\le e$$ since $$-1\le\cos(x)\le 1$$, so we know that $$\frac{\sqrt{10-x}}{\sqrt{x}}e^{\cos(x)}e\le \frac{\sqrt{10-x}}{\sqrt{x}}e$$.

<p>If someone could explain Q12 the last bit where it wants an outright approximation, I am uncertain how to go about it. Also, for Q13, part a, I got a slightly different answer than my friend, so if anyone knows where I went wrong or if they got the same, that would be great. I can&#39;t seem to see the error going through it,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you</p>","for Q12, you can just use a riemann sum/trapezoid rule of your choice, with a reasonable number of subdivisions. this is module A4. I used trapezoid with $$n=5$$. I am not sure if you would have needed to justify your choice of approximation, but it&#39;s probably smart to do so.<br /><br />for Q13, I expect the difference was that you divided your ODE by the proportionality limit while the other person did not. personally, I didn&#39;t either. if you read the question carefully, it states that $$a$$ is the proportionality constant <em>for the product of the number of zombies and humans,</em> so dividing by $$k$$ ruins that expression. if it just said proportionality constant with no further information, I would have gone with your approach.<br /><br />if anything explains this though, your friend&#39;s solution takes about a day while yours takes three years!"

<p></p>
<p>They skipped a step between the 2nd and 3rd line: $$e^x+x^2\ge e^x+1 \implies \frac{1}{e^x+x^2}\le \frac{1}{e^x+1}$$, where taking the inverse is justified because $$e^x+1$$ and $$e^x+x^2$$ are greater than $$0$$ and the inverse function is decreasing on $$(0,\infty)$$. Moreover, we know that $$e^x>0$$ for all $$x\in\mathbb{R}$$ so we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $$e^x$$ to get to the 3rd line.</p>
<p>I believe it should say $$e^x + x^2\ge e^x+1$$ in the 2nd line of the solution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ils ont sauté un étape entre le 2e et 3e ligne : $$e^x+x^2\ge e^x+1 \implies \frac{1}{e^x+x^2}\le \frac{1}{e^x+1}$$, où prenant l&#39;inverse est justifié parce que $$e^x+1$$ et $$e^x+x^2$$ sont plus grand que $$0$$ et la fonction inverse est décroissante sur $$]0,\infty[$$. De plus on sait que $$e^x>0$$ pour tout $$x\in\mathbb{R}$$ donc on peut multiplier les deux côtés d&#39;inégalité pour arriver à la 3e ligne.</p>
I believe it should say e^x &#43; x^2 &gt;= e^x &#43; 1 in the 2nd line of the solution"

A useful explanation of why this is the case can be found on this Math Stack Exchange post: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/637516/why-int-infty-infty-x-dx-neq-0

For 4(a), evaluating the indefinite integral $$\int\frac{1+x}{1+x^2}dx$$ gives $$\frac{1}{2}\ln(x^2+1)+\arctan x + C$$. Then, if you plug in the bounds and evaluate from $$-t$$ to $$t$$, you will get $$2\arctan t$$. Taking the limit as $$t\to\infty$$, you will get the answer of $$\pi$$. This value is called the _Cauchy Principle Value (PV)_.

**However**, for the second integral in 4(b) **which is not the same as 4(a)**, you **cannot** use the same method as you did in part (a). This integral diverges and the easiest way to show this is to see that $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1+x}{1+x^2}dx=\int_{-\infty}^{0}\frac{1+x}{1+x^2}dx+\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1+x}{1+x^2}dx$$ and seeing that both terms diverge when evaluated using the antiderivative.

For 4(a), evaluating the indefinite integral $$\int\frac{1+x}{1+x^2}dx$$ gives $$\frac{1}{2}\ln(x^2+1)+\arctan x$$. Then, if you plug in the bounds and evaluate from $$-t$$ to $$t$$, you will get $$2\arctan t$$. Taking the limit as $$t\to\infty$$, you will get the answer of $$\pi$$. This value is called the _Cauchy Principle Value (PV)_.

**However**, for the second integral in 4(b) **(which is not the same as 4(a))**, you **cannot** use the same method as you did in part (a). This integral diverges and the easiest way to show this is to see that $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1+x}{1+x^2}dx=\int_{-\infty}^{0}\frac{1+x}{1+x^2}dx+\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1+x}{1+x^2}dx$$ and seeing that both terms diverge when evaluated using the antiderivative.

TL;DR: $$\lim\limits_{t\to\infty}\int_{-t}^{t}f(x)\ dx \neq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)\ dx \equiv \lim\limits_{a\to-\infty}\lim\limits_{b\to\infty}\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\ dx$$.</md>

"TUT3 Q3: Hey everyone, just curious if doing a limit comparison to 2/sqrt(x) is also sufficient here. The solution decides to use a lower bound (cos(1)/sqrt(x)) instead of the upper bound which I am suggesting. I feel that the upper bound is more useful as it can prove convergence as well. Let me know if that makes sense...<br /><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flm7uk5b582wwb%2Ffada380926a09486253dd2b86ec7ea3bece5de8c279756009432d3d48152a16d%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.png"" />","there is nothing that proves convergence &#34;as well.&#34; if an upper bound is divergent, then the behavior of functions beneath it is indeterminate. likewise, if a lower bound is convergent, the behavior for functions above it is indeterminate. you can only draw conclusions from the other 2/4 cases.

"Midterm 2021 Answer Comparison: <p>Hi, I just wanted to compare some answers for the 2021 Midterm 1 and 2 with what others got since we don&#39;t have a key. Feel free to point out any mistakes I have.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I also had 3 questions that I was kind of stuck on and wanted to ask about;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Test 1 Q5, in my work I initially changed the bounds from x=-1 and x=-1/rt2 to theta=2pi/3 and theta=3pi/4 respectively, but my answer kept coming out to be the negative of the answer, but then I changed the bounds to the negatives of these and it works out fine. I chose the positives first cuz the integral is taking the values from quadrant 2, and so that means I should be using angles in the same quadrant, but it wouldn&#39;t work, so then I used the angles of the other quadrant where cos is negative and it worked. Could I get some clarification on how to work around that because I am kind of confused.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Test 2 Q1, I don&#39;t know how to start it entirely</p>
<p></p>
<p>Test 2 Q5, I am not sure what function to compare to? I initially compared it to 1/rtx^9, since it is always greater in the interval, but it only proved that 1/x^9/2 function diverges but not the question, and I can&#39;t seem to find something else to compare it to to ensure it either converges or diverges.</p>

Note that the sum can be written as $$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{1-(\frac{i}{n})^2}\ \frac{1}{n}$$. The $$\frac{i}{n}$$ term looks a lot like our $$x_i$$'s and the $$\frac{1}{n}=Δx$$ term tells us that the length of the interval is 1. Using the fact that $$x_i=a+iΔx$$ for a right-endpoint Riemann sum it is not hard to see that our bounds of integration is from 0 to 1. Thus, our definite integral is $$\int_0^1 \sqrt{1-x^2}\ dx$$, which is the area of the quarter circle of radius one centered at the origin. Thus, the value we are looking for is $$\frac{\pi}{4}$$.<br>

<p></p>","<p>Question 3 is about the length of an arc, not the area under a curve, so we can eliminate option A because it doesn&#39;t become more precise when we leave $$n\to\infty$$ (it remains constant, but the length of each arc is different).

<p></p>
<p>In question 5, the last three options are linked to the second derivative.

"Did we have to use the cooling law in question 2, HW2?: <p>In the second HW2 question, we were given two differential equations:</p>
<p>(1) $$T'(t)=\frac{2}{3}\left(A(t)-T(t)\right)$$</p>
<p>(2) $$T'(t)=\frac{2}{3}\left(A(t)-T(t)\right)+H(t)$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first is Newton&#39;s cooling law, which describes only the cooling rate. If there are no other sources of heat or cooling it equals the net change, but in the question we have an external source: the radiator $$H(t)$$.

<p>I assumed the question asked us to find $$H(t)$$ where $$\frac{2}{3}\left(A(t)-T(t)\right)+H(t)$$ would have equilibrium when $$T=20$$, so I wrote the equation $$0=\frac{2}{3}\left(A(t)-20\right)+H(t)$$ and then arrived at $$H(t)=\frac{40}{3}-\frac{8}{9}t$$ (since $$A(t)=\frac{4}{3}$$).</p>

<p>(the growth equation as given by the textbook)<br /><br />There&#39;s not really a more intuitive way than this. The textbook attempts to describe the intuition behind the equation in the next paragraph, though. </p>
<p>Hi, </p>
<p>This may not be the exact answer you want, but the logistic equation you aim to memorize can be derived from looking at birth rates (B) and death rates (D) for a given population (P), in addition to some constant of proportionality k over time T</p>
<p></p>
<p>In general, the population dP = k (B*P*dT - D*P*dT).  --&gt; dP/dT = kP(B-D). The logistic equation is derived by grouping some constants together and giving these groupings meanings based on their physical meanings. I guess in this case you would need to memorize the logistic equation given that the question uses terms like &#39;capacity&#39; which I think is code for M in the logistic equation dP/dT= kP (M-P). In other cases when given birth and death rates, it may serve to start from scratch (without the logistic equation)</p>"

The net change is therefore the sum of these two values. But M is the percentage of the population supporting Magenta, so we have to divide by a constant to calculate it. To integrate it, notice that it is a linear differential equation. For part b, use the initial condition $$M(20)=0.5$$ (in 20 days, you need to have at least 50 percent to win)."

How did you try to find the maximum of it. If you look at the first derivative and it isn&#39;t clear what the maximum is, there are a couple things you can do. For one, you can find the second derivative, because the max of the first derivative will happen when the second derivative is zero.<br /><br />or, in this case, since the first derivative is (tell me if you got something else because I might be wrong) $$−2e^{−sin^2(x)}cos(x)sin(x)$$ We can find the upper bound of the magnitude of each of these parts separately. So, $$|-2| \leq 2$$ and $$e^{-\sin^2(x)} \leq e$$ and $$|\sin(x)| \leq 1$$ and $$|\cos(x)| \leq 1$$, and we can take that together, though this will be a slightly less accurate bound"

"Question about Characteristic polynomial in the method of undetermined coefficients: <p>I was wondering why we would ever even need to find the characteristic polynomial when doing the method of undetermined coefficients when all you need is to take the original equation and plug into its y values the formula that you are using to guess. </p>
<p></p>
<p>e.g./ for y&#39;&#39; -4y&#39; -5y = 5t^2 - 2t</p>
<p></p>
<p>all you do is just try y = At^2 &#43; Bt &#43; C (1)</p>
<p>then y&#39; = 2at  &#43; b</p>
<p>then y&#39;&#39; = 2a</p>
<p></p>
<p>and you just sub and solve for the a b and c values and then put that back into (1) and then you have your particular solution. </p>
<p></p>
<p>is finding the characteristic polynomial and characteristic solution even necessary?</p>","<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re given the ODE: $$y''-4y'-5y=3e^{5t}$$. Say you skip finding the complementary solution and directly guess $$y(t)=Ae^{5t}$$, you&#39;ll find that at the end you have $$0=3e^{5t}$$. Now you have to go back and complete the whole process again with $$y(t)=Ate^{5t}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you had found the characteristic equation first, you would have gotten:</p>
<p>$$r^2-4r-5=0 \to (r-5)(r-1)=0\to r=5, r=1$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This makes your complementary solution $$c_1e^{5t}+c_2e^{t}$$. Now for some reason that I do not fully recall, because your original guess is actually part of the complementary solution, you should end up with the above invalid statement.

"Calculus Studying Methods: <p>Hi this isn&#39;t necessarily related to any in-course items, but I didn&#39;t do as well on the first midterm as I had anticipated, and calculus happens to be one of my weaker subjects. </p>
<p>I just wanted to use this platform to ask what study techniques I should use going forward that helped those who were initially struggling to improve, or to those who are already strong in this subject.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What I did to study for the first midterm was re-reading the in-class slideshows &amp; doing those examples on my own, textbook questions, going over written homework and then doing past exams. Is there anything else I should be doing?</p>","<p>I can&#39;t give you useful advice without the specific area that&#39;s causing you problems, but I will present some options depending on which part of math is the greatest struggle.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration:underline"">Calculation/Computation</span></p>
<p>If you find that you can set up equations but struggle to get the right answer, I can think of two additional practice methods (the only way to improve this is practice)</p>
<ol><li>Go backwards in a sense -- start with an answer and then generate a problem that produces the answer using the technique you struggle with. This gives you a sense of patterns that will emerge in constructed (exam) situations, but I only recommend this if you are already strong with the subject.</li><li>Generate random problems -- if you really want to you can download the WebWork software to generate problem sets on your own: <a href=""https://openwebwork.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://openwebwork.org/</a>. Otherwise, just write down random equations that should be solvable with the desired technique and try to get an answer (using sites such as WolframAlpha to verify)</li></ol>
<p><span style=""text-decoration:underline"">Theorem Application/Conceptual Questions</span></p>
<p>If you struggle to use theorems, I would suggest reading and working through the exercises contained in an introduction to proofs book/course. I will say this takes a lot of effort (it took me 6 months to get through a full course), but it is very good for developing your mathematical logic. Some books that I used that I found useful:</p>
<ul><li>Proofs and Fundamentals -- A First Course in Abstract Mathematics (Ethan D. Bloch, Birkhäuser 2000)</li><li>Book of Proof (Richard Hammack, online <a href=""http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/</a>)</li><li>Basic Analysis: Introduction to Real Analysis (Jiří Lebl, online <a href=""https://www.jirka.org/ra/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.jirka.org/ra/</a>) -- This one is more advanced but if you feel comfortable with set theory already it&#39;s a good exercise</li></ul>
<p><span style=""text-decoration:underline"">Word Problems</span></p>
<p>I would recommend doing physics textbook exercises that involve calculus (there are some in the ECE textbook). I don&#39;t really have much advice for this (d&#39;habitude je lis et je travaille en français donc les questions qui comprennent l&#39;interpretation des phrases causent des problèmes pour moi).</p>"
Last question on midterm marked wrong: Did anyone have the last question on the midterm marked completely wrong even though the answer matches the rubric exactly?,"<p>I believe the correct answer was a specific equation; the rubric refers to a substitution to eliminate $$T_2$$ using that $$T_1+T_2$$ is constant. I think the following is the correct answer:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$T_1'=4C_{in}-2C_{out}=4\frac{T_2}{100-2t}-2\frac{T_1}{100+2t}$$; since $$T_1+T_2=10$$ it follows that $$T_2=10-T_1$$ hence $$T_1'=4\frac{10-T_1}{100-2t}-2\frac{T_1}{10+2t}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I used a second-order derivative and lost the point on the exam. I don&#39;t know if you did something similar.</p>

<p>(Response to a comment) Your primitive is not exactly correct; taking the derivative we get $$\frac{x-1}{|x-1|(x^2-2x+10)}\ne\frac{1}{x^2-2x+10}$$ because the former is not defined at $$x=1$$, but the original function is defined there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The error occurs because the substitution $$\theta(x)=\arccos\left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{(x-1)^2+9}}\right)$$ violates the hypothesis of the theorem that allows us to make a change of variables. Recall the full statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose $$g:[a,b]\mapsto I$$ is a differentiable function with a continuous derivative, where $$I\subseteq\mathbb{R}$$ is an interval. Furthermore, suppose $$f:\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous on $$I$$. Then $$\int_a^b (f\circ g)(x)\cdot g'(x)\,dx=\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u)\,du$$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Note that $$\frac{d}{dx}\arccos\left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{(x-1)^2+9}}\right) = \frac{3(x-1)}{|x-1|\left((x-1)^2+9\right)}$$, a non-continuous function at $$x=1$$.</p>

"Second Order ODE behaviour (D3 PCE, D2 LEC): I am confused on what the graph of a second order solution is supposed to indicate?

<p></p>
<p>I thought in this example, we should have two e^(rts), one having &#43;i and the other having -i, thus having TWO sets of cosine and sine. How did our profs &#34;shrink&#34; it into only one cosine and one sine?</p>","<p>They combined the constants, starting with $$\alpha\exp\left(i\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right)+\beta\exp\left(-i\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right)$$, we can write $$\alpha\cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right) + \alpha\cdot i\sin\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right) + \beta\cos\left(-\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right) + \beta\cdot i\sin\left(\sqrt{-\frac{k}{m}}t\right)$$ by Euler&#39;s formula.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since $$\sin(-\theta)=-\sin(\theta)$$ et $$\cos(-\theta)=\cos(\theta)$$ we can therefore write $$\cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right)\left[\alpha+\beta\right] + \sin\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right)\left[i\alpha-i\beta\right]$$. Let $$c_1=\alpha+\beta$$ and $$c_2=i\alpha+i\beta$$, therefore $$c_1\cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right) + c_2\sin\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right)$$.</p>"

<p>We recommend the following for all your classes:</p>
<ul><li>Plan for the upcoming week under the assumption that there will NOT be a strike, i.e. assume that all lectures, all tutorials, all assessments etc. are running as usual, that there will be no new deadlines, no changes, no extensions.</li><li>Before heading out to class tomorrow morning, check your email inbox and the Quercus pages for all your courses for updates.</li><li>Even if a strike is happening, note that this does NOT necessarily mean that everything is cancelled.

<p>Also, regarding the midnight deadline, note that in previous negotiation rounds this deadline was sometimes extended into the early morning, so we might need to wait longer than midnight (I vaguely recall a few years ago where it took until 4am or something). Furthermore, even if a strike is called at midnight, it&#39;s unlikely that there will be any clear announcements within the first hours (since we will - hopefully - be asleep by then).

<p>I think the most important thing at this moment is to be aware of two things:</p>
<ol><li>We are all humans and we will navigate this whole situation in a way where we help each other out. Everyone has their understandable causes and goals (students, TAs, professors, ...) but it&#39;s important to keep in mind that in the end, everyone is doing their best to act in good faith to make this learning experience here at U of T as good as possible, both in the short run, and in the long run.</li><li>Sometimes, things in life are out of your control and the best is to try to not lose your mind (or your sleep) over this.

<p>Dear Instructor, </p>
<p></p>
<p>I am approximating tan(59) using tan(60) and input the exact value. However, the result is still incorrect. Can someone point out where is the mistake please? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>","<p>There is a technical issue with this question that is looked at to be fixed at the moment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the question asks for tan(59), then for some students (but not all students, it depends highly on the seed) WeBWorK still expects an answer for tan(61) instead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So in short, try answering the question under the assumption that you should approximate tan(61), then it should work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As said this only affects some students. For some, the question asks for tan(59) and this is the answer that will work.</p>

"Relationship between quasi-period and period: For questions that indicate the quasiperiod of an oscillation, I read that this refers to the time taken for the system to go between two successive peaks of motion. Thus, do the quasiperiod and period have the same values for an oscillation?","<p>For a function $$f$$ to be periodic, we require that $$f(x+T) = f(x) $$ for all x in the function&#39;s domain.  Here, $$T$$ represents the period.</p>

<p>This function <i>seems</i> periodic in the sense that the time it takes to go from peak to peak is constant, but it fails to meet the definition of periodic above ($$f(x+T) \neq f(x) $$). We call this function quasi-periodic, and we can find the quasi period by finding the time between successive peaks. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If we find the time between successive peaks for a $$\sin$$ function, it is $$2\pi$$, so it&#39;s &#39;quasi-periodic&#39; with period $$2\pi$$. We also know that $$\sin(x+2\pi) = \sin(x)$$ for any x, so $$\sin$$ is periodic by the definition I laid out in the beginning.</p>

<p>This function <i>seems</i> periodic in the sense that the time it takes to go from peak to peak is constant, but it fails to meet the definition of periodic above ($$f(x+T) \neq f(x) $$). We call this function quasi-periodic, and we can find the quasi period by finding the time between successive peaks. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If we find the time between successive peaks for a $$\sin$$ function, it is $$2\pi$$, so it&#39;s &#39;quasi-periodic&#39; with period $$2\pi$$. We also know that $$\sin(x+2\pi) = \sin(x)$$ for any x, so $$\sin$$ is periodic by the definition I laid out in the beginning.</p>
<p>For a function $$f$$ to be periodic, we require that $$f(x+T) = f(x) $$ for all x in the function&#39;s domain.  Here, $$T$$ represents the period.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, consider a function which we have discussed a lot in this course:</p>

"Webwork Q4: <p>Hi,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had a question about writing the Maclaurin series as a sum in webwork for the 4th question. I&#39;m not sure how to format how we take the nth derivative each time of the function, how would I write it down, because the only way I am used to writing derivatives is using &#39; . </p>
<p></p>
<p>thank you!</p>","<p>For the functions given in the question, it is possible to calculate an explicit formula for the nth derivative of a function.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, if we have the function $$f(x)=\frac{1}{2x}$$, we can write the n-th derivative as $$f^{(n)}(x)=\frac{n!(-1)^n}{2x^{n+1}}$$ (I advise you to verify why this formula works).</p>
<p></p>
<p>You need to do something similar for your answer to question 4.</p>
The best approach is to write the first 4 or 5 derivatives and then look for any pattern that merges. Then guess the $$n-$$th derivative based on your observation. Write your guess down and then cross-check it with the derivatives you already wrote. If it matches, use it to predict the next derivative.<br /><br />For the functions in this question, you will see a pattern that makes it feasible to write the general $$n$$-th derivative. "

To determine the interval of convergence requires us to determine the radius of convergence using the ratio test. 

Computing the values for which $$L= lim_{n\to\infty} |\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| < 1$$ where the series converges will directly lead to the determination of the radius of convergence.

Example)
Consider a given ratio test leads to the following: $$L=2 |4x-8|$$.

For the series for converge...
$$L<1$$ and so $$2 |4x-8| = 8 |x-2|< 1$$.

Thus, 
$$|x-2| < \frac{1}{8}$$

In this case the Radius of convergence, R = $$\frac{1}{8}$$

Now for the interval of convergence...
$$|x-2| < \frac{1}{8} \implies  \frac{-1}{8} < |x-2| < \frac{1}{8} $$

Thus the interval of convergence is the following....
$$\frac{15}{8} < x < \frac{17}{8} $$

Now the series converges for any x-value within the above interval of convergence. Note that at the endpoints we have to check for convergence or divergence separately.

"Radius of Convergence Inquiry: <p>When we solve for the radius of convergence for a given series, we use the ratio test: $$\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}$$. In LEC0102, we did this example:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Find the radius of convergence for the series $$\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we do the ratio test: $$\displaystyle\frac{\frac{x\cdot x^n}{(n+1)!\cdot n}}{\frac{x^n}{n!}}$$ which becomes:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{x}{n+1}$$ which we say that the limit goes to zero. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So in this case, do we say that the series converges for <strong>every</strong> value of $$x$$, and that the interval of convergence is $$(-\infty,\infty)$$?</p>

"Approximating error using Taylor&#39;s Remainder Theorem: <md>I stumbled upon this question in 2021 Test 4:

To approach this I decided to take $$p_2(t)$$ as the approximation and use $$R_2(t)$$ together with $$g'''(t)$$ to narrow down the error boundary. However I am not sure how to properly utilize the given boundaries for $$g'''(x)$$.

Since there are two distinct restrictions on $$g'''(x)$$, I am calculating two $$R_2(t)$$'s and see for which one I get smaller $$t^*$$ in $$p_2(t^*)+R_2(t^*)>0$$. Is my process correct?</md>","<p>it&#39;s there to help you find $$R(x)$$, since you need the maximum absolute value of the third derivative on the interval between the center and approximated point. since the absolute value reaches up to 6 between $$[1,t]$$, you should use that as the value for $$f(z)$$. I believe the 2 is simply there to throw you off if you take the maximum regular value instead of absolute.</p>

<p>if you check both though, you&#39;ll find the error of 6 is larger, so I guess it still works, but is not necessary.</p>"

"neglecting gravity when taking extension from equilibrium and external force: <p>when we take x and extension from the equilibrium position of a vertical spring, we do not have to include the force of gravity as shown by this explanation from the textbook.</p>
<p>Does this also apply in the case that there is an external force (like if there is a drag coefficient or the right side does not equal 0)?</p>

<p></p>","<p>You can treat the force from gravity in two different ways. </p>
<p></p>
<p>1) You can think of a vertical spring without the mass, and call the equilibrium of that system zero. Then add the mass and treat the new force $$mg$$ you introduced as an external force. In this case, your new equilibrium (equilibrium with the mass) is not at the zero anymore. <br /><br /><br /></p>
<p></p>
<p>2) Alternatively, you can think of the mass as part of the system and set the equilibrium with the mass as zero. In this case, the gravity force is already taken into account when you write your ODE. <br /><br />The difference between (1) and (2) is a change of variable. Note that you could do this because the force of gravity is constant and is applied uniformly. You can argue similarly for any other &#34;external&#34; constant force. </p>"

radius of convergence: Is the idea of having a radius of convergence of something is only applicable on power series?  ,The radius of convergence only makes sense when you have a series that involves a variable. Depending on the value of the variable your series can be convergent or divergent. if your series is in the form of a power series (infinite polynomial) the series will be convergent within an interval and divergent outside of it.

"Question regarding radius of convergence from lecture: <p>From the question below, we know with context that from a centre of -2, it has at least a radius of convergence of 4. However, we don&#39;t know for a fact if the x-value at exactly 4 away, so x=2, and x=-6, will converge, since at these two points L is potentially 1. However, since we know x=2 converges, don&#39;t we also know that x=-6 is also inclusive?</p>

<p></p>",A damped oscillator without an external force will die out. The long-term behavior of a damped oscillator with an external force in general will depend on the interaction between the external force and the internal properties of the system. The safest way to predict the en behavior is to write the general form of the solution and take the limit.

<p><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flm7ul7s687n4fe%2F387df73e0a8b9bc9fe73e29f0599cf232924522a9541ead9a36c19b686beb275%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.png"" /></p>","<p>(Le traducteur s&#39;est cassé et c&#39;est trop tard pour essayer le réparer maintenant, mais je traduirai cette réponse au matin.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The change follows from the formula for the value of a telescopic series : $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(a_n-a_{n+1}\right) = a_0-\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}a_n$$. In this case $$a_n=\frac{1}{n} \implies a_{n+1}=\frac{1}{n+1}$$, so the formula gives us $$\frac{1}{1}-\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}=1-0=1$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To your second question I can&#39;t find the exact slide where the formula is discussed, but the proof is simple using induction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let $$a_p$$ be a real sequence and $$S_n=\sum^n_{m=1} a_m-a_{m+1}$$ a sequence of partial sums. We want to show that $$S_n=a_1-a_{n+1}$$ pour tout $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$.</p>
<p>For the base case, suppose that $$n=2$$. It follows that $$S_n=a_1-a_2+a_2-a_3=a_1-a_3=a_1-a_{n+1}$$.</p>
<p>For induction, suppose que $$S_k=a_1-a_{k+1}$$. Notice that $$S_{k+1}=\sum_{m=1}^{k+1}a_m-a_{m+1}=\sum_{m=1}^{k}\left[a_m-a_{m+1}\right]+a_{k+1}-a_{k+2}=S_k+a_{k+1}-a_{k+2}$$. By induction hypothesis we deduce that $$S_{k+1}=a_1-a_{k+1}+a_{k+1}-a_{k+2}=a_1-a_{k+2}$$.</p>
<p>By induction, we deduce that $$S_n=a_1-a_{n+1}$$ for all $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$. $$\blacksquare$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>From here it&#39;s easy (take a limit) to demonstrate the case where $$n\to\infty$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Le traducteur s&#39;est cassé et c&#39;est trop tard pour essayer le réparer maintenant, mais je traduirai cette réponse au matin.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Le changement suit de la formule pour le valeur d&#39;une série télescopique : $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(a_n-a_{n+1}\right) = a_0-\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}a_n$$. En ce cas on à $$a_n=\frac{1}{n} \implies a_{n+1}=\frac{1}{n+1}$$, donc le formule nous donne $$\frac{1}{1}-\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}=1-0=1$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>À votre deuxième question je ne trouve plus la diapositive exacte où on discute la formule, mais la démonstration est simple en utilisant la raisonnement par récurrence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Soient $$a_p$$ une série réel et $$S_n=\sum^n_{m=1} a_m-a_{m+1}$$ une série des sommes partielles. On veut démontrer que $$S_n=a_1-a_{n+1}$$ pour tout $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$.</p>
<p>Pour l&#39;initialisation, suppose que $$n=2$$. Il suit que $$S_n=a_1-a_2+a_2-a_3=a_1-a_3=a_1-a_{n+1}$$.</p>
<p>Pour l&#39;hérédité, suppose que $$S_k=a_1-a_{k+1}$$. On note que $$S_{k+1}=\sum_{m=1}^{k+1}a_m-a_{m+1}=\sum_{m=1}^{k}\left[a_m-a_{m+1}\right]+a_{k+1}-a_{k+2}=S_k+a_{k+1}-a_{k+2}$$. Par l&#39;hypothèse on déduit que $$S_{k+1}=a_1-a_{k+1}+a_{k+1}-a_{k+2}=a_1-a_{k+2}$$.</p>
<p>Par raisonnement par récurrence, on déduit que $$S_n=a_1-a_{n+1}$$ pour tout $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$. $$\blacksquare$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>D&#39;ici il est simple (prend une limite) de démontrer le cas où $$n\to\infty$$.</p>
<p></p>
This is probably what the student answer&#39;s getting at, but $$1/n - 1/(n+1)$$ is a telescoping series. That is, most of the terms cancel out. At term $$x$$ it&#39;s $$\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{x+1}$$ and at the next term it&#39;s $$\frac{1}{x+1} - \frac{1}{x+2}$$ so the $$\frac{1}{x+1}$$ term gets cancelled out. So, when we look at the whole series, the only thing that doesn&#39;t get cancelled out is the first and &#39;last&#39; term. The first term is 1, and the &#39;last&#39; term is the limit of -1/(n&#43;1) as n goes to infinity"

"Question re. alternating series test: <p>For the alternating series test, I understand intuitively that, in order for a series to converge, $$\lim_{x\rightarrow inf} b_{n} = 0$$. However, I can&#39;t make sense of why $$b_{n} > 0$$. If the series is alternating, why does it matter whether $$b_{n}$$ is greater or less than 0? Also, regarding the condition that states $$b_{n}$$&#39;s are non-increasing, does it simply imply that $$b_{n}$$ is a harmonic term with $$p > 0$$? </p>

Thank you so much!</p>","Saying $$b_n &gt; 0$$ is just a “fancy” way of saying all $$b_n$$ terms should be the same sign to apply this convergence test. If all $$b_n$$’s are negative, you can just factor that negative out of the sum. Now, just like that, they’re all positive. When it says $$b_n$$ is non increasing, i believe that just means that over the interval of summation, if $$n_2 &gt; n_1$$ then $$b_{n_2} \le b_{n_1}$$ (this is the definition of a decreasing function). "

You need to be able to use the convergence tests we discussed: divergence test, ratio test, and alternating test. You also need to recognize popular series like geometric and harmonic series. <br /><br />There is not much to memorize/remember. Given a power series, you apply the ratio test to find its radius of convergence and apply any other test that works for the endpoints if you need to know the behaviors of the endpoints. "

<p>it seems to me that everytime when a mass spring system is horizontal, it comes out as:</p>
<p></p>
<p>F=ma=-uv-kx</p>
<p>ma&#43;uv&#43;kx= external force. (The point is that every term ends up being positive, is this always the case ?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, for mass spring with gravity:</p>
<p></p>
<p>F=ma=-uv</p>
<p>ma&#43;uv = mg (gravity is treated as external force) ( is this also the usual case for this kind of system?</p>","I believe you should just think about it a certain way and stick with it for all spring questions. If you think about a spring going horizontally (no gravity). define that the mass going to the right is positive displacement. Notice how when the spring moves to the right, the spring is going to stretch out and result in a force in the opposite direction. Therefore because we can say that the spring force will act in the opposite direction when the mass goes in the positive direction, we have to put a negative sign for the spring force. Therefore we currently have ma = -kx. Say we have an external force, F, we can say that the direction of the force is out defined positive, and just imagine which way our mass will be pushed (if the spring would compress it would push to the other side and if its stretched, it would pull the mass towards itself). Generally, our force would cause the spring to stretch, and so we would have the ODE, ma = F - kx as the force acts one way but the spring acts the other way. Say we have gravity now. In this scenario the mass spring system is moving up and down (vertically). I believe it is easier to imagine the weight as the positive direction. If you release the block from rest, the block will go down (because of the weight force which we defined to be positive) and the spring will clearly want to bring the mass back up, so the spring will be negative (as it is bringing the mass in the opposite direction of the weight). Therefore we would have ma = mg - kx. 
I think that since x(T) outputs displacement in a direction, the direction of the: spring force, and damping force will be given by the sign of x(T) and x’(T) output. <div><br /></div><div>Cannot confirm yet though, still a theory.   </div>"

"Effect of gravity on spring questions: I am very confused on why gravity is not factored into spring questions even if they are vertical. I have read the textbook explanation, but I am still confused as to why we are neglecting the influence of mg on the overall force summation, and we only include kx and uv in the ODE. Could I get an explanation as to why exactly it is not considered? Something about new equilibrium and factored in doesn&#39;t make sense, why is it that gravity is factored in the equilibrium?","It is just the whys the questions are organized I guess. You never include anything else until explicitly told. The most basic is just force and spring constant; you don&#39;t even include damping forces. Usually when they say external forces are involved you know that you have to consider gravity. 
We are not neglecting it. You set up the ODE as $$mx''+\mu x'+kx=mg$$, where $$x$$ measures the displacement from the spring&#39;s equilibrium without the mass attached. Let&#39;s call the new equilibrium of the system after you attach the mass $$x_1$$. Then $$mg=kx_1$$. Hence, after simplification, your ODE becomes $$mx''+\mu x'+k(x-x_1)=0$$. Call $$y=x-x_1$$ (a change of variable). Note that this change does not affect the derivatives, that is $$y'=x'$$ and $$y''=x''$$. Rewrite the ODE as $$my''+\mu y'+ky=0$$ This ODE is modeling the same system, now your variable measures the distance from the equilibrium with the mass attached.

Notice here the denominator grows much much faster than the numerator. For example consider...

Consider n=2, for example....

$$\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}$$ = $$\frac{3^5}{2^{19}}$$

As you can see the $$denominator >> numerator$$ due to the higher exponent on n in the exponential. This discrepancy only gets bigger and bigger as n increases, making the term $$\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}$$ approach 0 as n gets sufficiently large.

<p>Here you&#39;ve made a mistake with the algebra; the rule of powers says that $$\int x^n\,dx= \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+C$$, thus $$\int x^{2n}\,dx =\frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}+C$$ and not $$\frac{x^{2n+1}}{2^{n+1}}$$.</p>
You can integrate/differentiate the general term. However, I do recommend writing the first few terms to see how they change. When you use the sigma notation, you can also incorporate the change by changing the indexing, which may become confusing."

"Justification for exchanging a limit and an integral: <p>During Thursday&#39;s lecture (section 103), we calculated a series to express $$\ln(1-x)$$ for $$x\in(-1,1)$$ using the following process:</p>
<p>$$\frac{1}{1-t}=\lim\limits_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=0}^N t^n,\quad t\in]-1,1[$$</p>
<p>$$\int_0^x \frac{1}{1-t}\,dt = \int_0^x \lim\limits_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=0}^N t^n\, dt, \quad x\in]-1,1[$$</p>
<p>$$-\ln(1-x) = \lim\limits_{N\to\infty} \sum_{n=0}^N \int_0 ^x t^n\,dt$$</p>
<p>$$\ln(1-x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}.$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>I understand that the first line describes the uniform convergence of $$f_p(t)=\sum_{n=0}^p t^n$$ to $$f(t)=\frac{1}{1-t}$$ on the domain $$(-1,1)$$, and that because of this we can take the definite integral on $$[0,x]$$ if $$x\in(-1, 1)$$ [PfW1] to deduce the second line.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I don&#39;t understand the third line, specifically how we can deduce $$\lim\limits_{N\to\infty}\int_0^x \sum_{n=0}^N t^n\,dt$$ from $$\int_0^x \lim\limits_{N\to\infty} \sum_{n=0}^N t^n\,dt$$. That is, I don&#39;t understand why we can change the order of the integral and the limit, as there are cases in which this fails (a math professor named Michael Penn made a video about a counterexample but I can&#39;t find it right now). What property(ies) of the mathematical objects allow us to do this? (I would prefer a rigorous answer rather than a heuristic argument).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If $$\displaystyle (f_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$$ is a sequence of Riemann integrable functions defined on a compact interval $${\displaystyle I}$$ which uniformly converge with limit $${\displaystyle f}$$, then $${\displaystyle f}$$ is Riemann integrable and its integral can be computed as the limit of the integrals of the $${\displaystyle f_{n}}$$ : $$\displaystyle \int_I f=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \int_I f_n$$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since $$\frac{1}{1-t}=\lim\limits_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=0}^N t^n$$ uniformly for $$t\in(-1,1)$$, the above theorem applies so the interchange is justified.</p>

<p>For example, consider the sum $$\sum_{n=1}^3[n^2\cdot n]=\sum_{n=1}^3 n^3$$. Evaluating it, we calculate an answer of $$1+8+27=36$$. But, if we evaluate the sum $$\sum_{n=1}^3 [n^2]\times\sum_{n=1}^3[n]$$ we calculate a totally different answer: $$[1+4+9]\times[1+2+3]=14\times 6=84\ne 36$$.</p>

<p></p>","Not answering your question here, but just letting you know you shouldn&#39;t just post the entire answer for everyone to see. Crop the image.
To obtain the x intervals you need to consider more than just the endpoints of the theta intervals.

Instead think about the minimum/maximum value that x can be over the theta interval. Does that clarify the intervals?"

<p>I don&#39;t understand why the interval would be [0,inf) for this to be correct</p>","<md>The polar curve is parametrised in time, we start at $$t=0$$ and continue on to infinity. Picking $$t=0$$ is fairly arbitrary, but going to infinity ensures we plot all of the curve (versus a finite bound which gives us a curve segment). Also the statement says ""for all time t"" :\)</md>

The question asks you to find the parametric expression for the loop without the &#34;tails&#34; of the curve. With your parameterization, the left tail is given by $$t\in(-1,0)$$ and the bottom tail is given by $$t\in(-\infty,-1)$$. Since we don&#39;t care about this, we exclude these intervals."

Area under polar curves: What methods are there to find the bounds of integration for finding area under a polar curve without knowing what the actual graph looks like?,"When you find the area under a curve in polar form, you’re actually finding the area of the space bounded by the curve and two rays that share a common origin.

"Difference between chain ruling and dividing derivatives for Parametric curves: I&#39;m not sure if I missed this in lectures, but for parametric curves, instead of doing y&#39;(t)/x&#39;(t) could you instead do dy/dt*dt/dx? It&#39;ll probably just be a lot more annoying in more scenarios considering how you might have to implicitly differentiate the function, but is it still valid? Is there any scenario where you cannot use y&#39;(t)/x&#39;(t) (aside from like x&#39;(t) = 0) or is that a general formula? ","dy/dt is equivalent to y&#39;(t) and dx/dt is equivalent to x&#39;(t).
