"CS 136 Assignment Component: While doing A1 Q2, a doubt about this course came to mind. 

So the question said that if I did 5 assignments and got 500 marks (100%), and 100% for style, I would get 100% for the assignment component, but still fail the course because I did not reach the minimum number of assignments submitted. 

Can I therefore assume that if I did 6 out of the 9 assignments (bare minimum) with complete scores and style, I will still obtain a 100% for the assignment component, which accounts for 20% weighted on the final calculated grade, without doing the last 3 assignments?

Please correct me if I am wrong. Thank you :)","<p>Yes</p>

If something can be re-written into one line of the return statement, why use 5 lines of if statements?</p>
<p>2) You should use assertion for each function to ensure the function works as you expected. *By &#34;expected&#34;, this actually means that you filtered all invalid input (yes we might test them for assignments to make sure you assert them and pay attention to requirements.

And this is asking you to add a new line after the last number.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Nomair] While the instructor answer tells you where to find this in the assignment rules, let me explain very briefly why this is needed. There are two main reasons:</p>
<p>- In linux a file is considered properly formatted if it ends with a line feed. Windows has no such requirement. Many editors (such as the black boxes you see in EdX do not automatically add a line feed at the end). When the text added in such editors is moved to a file on linux (that is what happens when you press Run Code or Submit to Marmoset, Marmoset can have issues with no line feeds at the end (since it is running on linux).</p>
<p>- Another reason is that a line feed is represented as an actual character in the file. If we ever want to try to compare two files they must match identically. Related to this is also if we try to read a file. We might write code that says &#34;read to the next line feed&#34;. If there is no line feed at the end, some parts of the text file might not actually get read.</p>
<p></p>
<md>Ctrl/Command + F ""line feed"" in assignment rules to find it. And this is asking you to add a new line after the last number.</md>"

"A1 - Q2: <p>I&#39;m quite confusing about this example</p>
<p></p>
<p> if a student had 20% in their midterm and 65% in their final, they would have earned exactly 50% for the exam component. If a student had 80% in their midterm and 29% in their final, they would have earned exactly 46% for the exam component.</p>
<p></p>
<p>how can this be 50 % and 46%? </p>","<md>1/3 of the exam component is the midterm and 2/3 is the final since the final weighs twice as much as the midterm.

"Clarification about A1Q2 rounding: <p>Summary of questions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. In instruction, it says &#34;Luckily, we round to the closest integer when calculating marks.&#34;</p>

"A01 Question2: If I didn&#39;t get it wrong, we should do this question based on all the rules listed on the marking scheme right? like we need to consider assignment and exams respectively and also the overall grade.

Earn 50% of the total marks respectively?<img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flkqweq4wfuz1fb%2F093111a84f8fb31d6ff92f631857cbd2a93432cb8a19ef5a7992f968e3abd65f%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.pngNaN"" />","<p>Yes, read the rules on the marking scheme, it helped me a lot with this question.</p>

<p>From my understanding, there are 3 things you need to pass: </p>
<p>1. Overall course, that is 50% in everything, taking the weighting of each part into account</p>
<p>2. Exam component, which is only midterm and final (not quizzes), which is also weighted, and since midterm is 25% of overall mark and final is 50%, you would weight those against each other</p>
<p>3. Assignment component, where you consider if you passed either with or without including style marks</p>

Count style for overall grade?: should we count style into our assignment when we calculate the overall grade. I know we need to consider it when dealing with individual component.,"Yes, style counts for the overall grade. Style counts as an assignment, which means that it needs to be factored into the assignment mark, which itself needs to be factored into the overall mark."
helper function: are we allowed to use helper functions for all of the questions?,"Yep, you can. In the instructions it says that the content cut-off for A1 is Section (Session?) 1, and that you must use recursion and helper functions in place of variables and loops. 
As a general rule, you are always allowed to write and use helper functions. Usually, helper functions will end up in better code."
"Question 3: <p>if we have 19 as our sum, should we simplify it into 0? since 1&#43;9 =10 and our last digit of card number is 0</p>

As far as I can tell we use assert when writing tests in the main function? As well as something to do with contracts?</p>

<p>Could someone please clear this up for me?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>","<p>Assertions are covered in slides 85-91 of Section 1 (you can find these on edX). You might not have heard about it in class because your instructor may not have gotten that far yet. A TL;DR: C has an <code>assert</code> function that takes in a boolean expression and does nothing if it evaluates to true, gives you an error if it evaluates to false. Try this in the sandbox, and then try it after commenting out line 5:</p>
<p></p>
<p><code>#include &#34;cs136.h&#34;<br /><br />int main(void) {<br />  assert(1 == 1);<br />  assert(1 == 2);<br />  assert(4 == 2&#43;2);<br />  return 0;<br /></code><code>}</code><code></code><code></code></p>
<p></p>
<p>You can use assertions for testing (i.e. it&#39;s like a replacement for <code>check-expect</code>s) - see slides 90 and 91 - and for enforcing program requirements, i.e. the requirements in your contract for a function should be checked explicitly using assert - see slide 86. </p>"

Yes.

No, this is just for the `read_int` function that we provide you for now in this course. Once we get to pointers, you will use `scanf(...)` to read input and handle read failures differently,</md>"

<p>[Nomair] YES!! That is indeed the goal. I believe we switch over in A5 once we have covered VS Code. For now, it depends on how Marmoset is being set up by the ISAs. For example, as Alex said, you could copy and paste your EdX code into .c files and submit it. Whether Marmoset will be happy with it, I am unsure. The reason: it might also be expecting files like cs136.h or io-tests.{c,h} to be submitted. If that is the case, it might not be possible. The instructor response before this seems to indicate that it might be okay. Try it. Let me know in a followup how it goes.

[Alex]: Constants should be ALL_CAPS if their values don't really matter, e.g., we let directions be 1, 2, 3, 4, but we could have let them be -1, -2, -3, -4 or 10, 20, 30, 40, etc. All we want were four distinct values so we could tell them apart, what exactly the values were didn't matter that much.

However, if for example we want to let $$\pi$$ be 3.14, then we would do `const float pi = 3.14;` in lowercase, because this is not arbitrary, we can't let `pi` be any other random value. (note that you can't use `float` in your assignment unless otherwise specified, this is just an example)</md>

<p>In cases like this, where we might have lots of if statements where we are comparing many similar things, it would seem perhaps to be better style to use more spacing, in exchange for making the meaning of the code more clear.

In my code, I also made single-line if statements which were said to be bad in a previous question. The feedback specifically said &#34;Inconsistent indentation.&#34;<br /><br /></p>
<p>This is, of course, my opinion, but I think it is reasonable, but little things like this make the code far more clean and readable, and I don&#39;t think it is fair for us to lose marks when we put in extra effort to make our code look clean.  </p>","Please refer to the style guide only for this course, you can use any style outside the course."

<p>[Nomair] While it is typically okay to not use the provided functions, do note that stylistically it is always better to use existing functions. The reason has to do with testing and confidence in code. If you know that a function does what it is supposed to do, then you can rely on this information. At the same time, code reuse through helper functions helps reduce code clones. I would say it is fine to perhaps not use the provided functions but if you are duplicating the work that is already done by a helper, you are not following good programming practices.</p>

<p></p>
<p>There is a lot of separate posts about what kind of input q1b read_topping() can take and I wanted to ask some questions to try and get full clarification.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. The instructions say &#34;The function uses valid inputs to update *t and returns true.&#34;</p>
<p>So if you give it <kbd>h $</kbd> , technically h is a valid input, so will it update t and return true? Or does it wait to scan the next char (in this case $)  as well and then decide if <strong>both</strong> are valid before updating t?</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Should the function only scan 2 times max? for instance if I give it <kbd>7 c 8 </kbd>will it not matter because the function has already returned false (7 is not a valid name)</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. How much error handling do we have to account for? Should the function only work if it gets a character, then an int, <strong>in that order?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>I understand that in some cases this is technically specified in the instructions, but they are not clear enough for me to be confident about how I am implementing the program.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>","<md>1. Valid input means **both** name **and** price.

2. The function attempts to read exactly one character and one integer.
If the input is
```
r
7 c 8
...
```
Then yes, 7 is not a valid name so `read_topping` fails.

3. Yes, a character followed by an integer.</md>
Adding to 2, would it be a successful read if the something follows a character then a integer like: c 25 20?  Would it still return this: Name: c Price: 25, or would it just fail? "
"Clarification: <p><strong>Q</strong>: If there are less than 5 valid toppings in the input, the character/command that follows right after them will have already been consumed by the time <code>read_topping</code> fails, do we need to restore it?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: No. We made tests with this pitfall in mind, if there are less than 5 toppings, then treat the immediate next command as a dummy character.</p>
<p>Does this mean we do not have to worry about  if read_topping fails to read 5 toppings and consumes the next input (such as calling print lets say)</p>","<md>For example if you have:

Better Understanding of the Slides: Are there any youtube channels that you would recommend that cover maybe not all but some of the contents of the course just in a different perspective?,"Unfortunately I don&#39;t know of any specifically (I encourage students to chime in if they have any recommendations!!). The course textbook does have a different perspective, but if you&#39;d like something in video format I recommend you just search up the topic you&#39;d like a different perspective for on youtube and try a few channels to see what you like best. There&#39;s quite a bit of material online for C so I think chances are high that you&#39;ll find something that suits you. If all else fails you are more than welcome to visit someone in office hours (or book an appointment with somebody if the times don&#39;t work for you) to ask for a different explanation - or talk to your friends in the course! They can explain a topic you&#39;re struggling with to you, and you can explain a topic you&#39;re struggling with to them. When I was a student, I found that I really understood the material best when I taught it to someone, so this back-and-forth with someone else is a great way for both of you to learn. Plus, all that time we spent together made us better friends 🥹"

<p>Constants are variables. We use “variables” for both mutable ones and constants.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Edit: while constants technically are variables, they&#39;re still considered different because of their immutability. When they&#39;re global, they&#39;re even stored in a different area of memory (see Session 03&#39;s slides). Thus we wouldn&#39;t count &#34;one&#34; as a variable in this context. Here, we know the global variable &#34;two&#34; is in scope everywhere, so that&#39;s one variable in scope. &#34;three&#34; is a parameter, not a variable (even though you can modify it within the scope of foo). Within foo, since the variable &#34;four&#34; is defined right at the start and not in any other code blocks, it has scope throughout foo too. &#34;five&#34; is defined within the if-block, so it only has scope within that block. &#34;six&#34; is defined after the &#34;// HERE&#34; line so it doesn&#39;t have scope at the point that line is reached - variables only have scope starting from where they are defined. &#34;seven&#34; is a local variable in main, so it doesn&#39;t have scope in foo. Thus, there&#39;s only two variables in scope when &#34;// HERE&#34; is reached. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>I&#39;m confused as to what the actual output should be with multiple conflicting answers on Piazza.

"general rules for assertions: For the assignments as well as the midterms, I&#39;m looking to create some general guidelines for assertions to help with my studying.<br /><br />Ex. length of an array must be non-negative, pointers must not be NULL, denominator != 0, stuff like that. <br /><br />I&#39;d like to hear some of your ideas based on the style guide and restrictions that make logical sense.<br /><br />Also question: can the length of an array be zero? will our code be tested with nonempty arrays?","<md>I'd say the general rules are:
* Assert everything that is *explicitly* stated in the `requires`-section of the documentation, except when it is impossible to assert.
* Assert *implicit* asserts, i.e., asserts demanded by the style guide. These are:
  * Assert that a pointer-type parameter is not `NULL`, e.g., `assert(dest)` or `assert(dest != NULL)`
  * Assert that an array-type parameter is not `NULL`, e.g., `assert(arr)` or `assert(arr != NULL)`
  * Assert that the array-length parameter is positive, e.g., `assert(arr_len > 0)` or `assert(arr_len >= 1)`

The length of an array **cannot** be zero. You can think about it like this: The *value* of an array is the same as the *address* of its first element. If the length is zero, there is no first element, thus no address. If you want the more formal reason: because C says so! (""If the expression is a constant expression, it shall
have a value greater than zero"", see [6.7.5.2 (1)](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf#page=128))</md>

do we need to memorize the size of different data types?: do we need to memorize the size of different data types? Like would we needa know that the size of an int is 4 bytes?,"<md>Yes, I would memorize them. Good news is that there are only 4 to remember:
* `char` => 1
* `int` and `bool` => 4
* any pointer-types and array-type *parameters*: => 8

Furthermore:
* You can calculate the size of an array by multiplying its length with the size of each element.
* You can calculate the *minimum* size of a structure by adding up the sizes of its fields.

Let's talk about `bool` for a sec. The `bool`-type in itself does not exist in core C; this is why you have to `#include <stdbool.h>` if you want to use it (same for `true` and `false`). `true` and `false` are defined as `1` and `0` respectively, so `trace_int(sizeof(true))` and `trace_int(sizeof(false))` will both yield `4`. `trace_int(sizeof(bool))`, however, will yield `1` because the underlying data type `_Bool` *in our system* is a so-called ""single-bit bit-field"", so its size is actually just 1 bit! Since the smallest addressable unit is 1 byte, however, the size of a `bool` is 1 byte (in our system). The C standard is quite unhelpful as it only states that ""An object declared as type _Bool is large enough to store the values 0 and 1."" ([6.2.5 (2)](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf#page=45)). Thanks! In the context of CS136, we simply assume that a `bool` will use 4 bytes!</md>

Consider: code is *read* vastly more often than it is written.  It is written only once, but read repeatedly (possibly while editing, but each edit happens only once, by definition!).  You want to make your code easy to read.

The concise version saves 7 keystrokes, which takes about 1.5 seconds to type.  But every time you think ""wait, what's the difference between `++i` and `i++` ?"", it will cost a little time.  Likely a second or two.  Thinking about that will interrupt the flow of understanding.

Write a little more, and make your code clearer.

It is just like with writing any text: don't write flowery long sentences that are are to understand.

<p>What is the answer to this question? The length is 3, and the size of each struct pos would be 16 bytes, so there would be at least 32 bytes, but what would the last element and the size of the last element be? <br /><br />This also leads to the question that when a local array is filled with random values at the end, what are the size of those elements?</p>","When an array is initialized with variables in it, an empty structure is filled in all slots that don&#39;t contain anything by the compiler. Since the array has the length 3, and a structure is 16. 16 * 3 = 48
When an array is initialized with variables in it, empty 0s are filled in all slots that don&#39;t contain anything by the compiler. Since the array has the length 3, and an int is 4 bytes 32 &#43; 4 = 36

.in &amp; .expect: Why we should end up with a new line in our .in &amp; .expect file?,"<md>You don't necessarily need a newline (`'\n'`) at the end of a `.in`-file.

As for a `.expect`-file, it usually makes your code easier if you have a newline at the end of the `.expect`-file. The reason is the following: image, you need to output the elements from an array, e.g., an `int`-array:

```
int data[] = {1, 3, 6};
int data_len = 3;
for (int i = 0; i < data_len; ++i) {
    printf(""%d\n"", data[i]);
}
```

This prints a newline at the end of the last output, so the correct `.expect`-file would need that newline as well:

```
1
3
6

```

If you would not put a newline at the end of your `.expect`-file:

```
1
3
6
```

you would need to treat the output for the last (or the first) data differently, which would just make your code more awkward.

```
int data[] = {1, 3, 6};
int data_len = 3;
for (int i = 0; i < data_len - 1; ++i) {
    printf(""%d\n"", data[i]);
}
printf(""%d"", data[data_len - 1]);

or this:
```
int data[] = {1, 3, 6};
int data_len = 3;
printf(""%d"", data[0]);
for (int i = 1; i < data_len; ++i) {
    printf(""\n%d"", data[i]);

The code you have posted a screenshot of is an example of a function returning an address within its stack frame.

<p></p>
<p>int func(int);</p>
<p>int func(int);</p>
<p>int func(int);</p>
<p></p>
<p>would this just have the exact same effect of only declaring it once? Also what would happen if I had:</p>
<p></p>
<p>int func(char);</p>
<p>int func(int);</p>
<p></p>
<p>Would the program just use whichever declaration that has matching parameters with the definition?</p>","<md>Good question!

First, nothing can be **defined** multiple times because a definition creates an instance, and when there are multiple instances with the same name and you use that name, the program doesn't know which one of them it should use.

But things can be **declared** multiple times. When you declare something, you are telling the program to assume it exists, so go ahead and use it. There is no problem telling the program multiple times that something exists, as long as there is a unique instance of that thing so the program knows it should use that.

`extern` basically means something is defined elsewhere.

It is optional for functions because there must be curly braces to define a function and simply `int func(int);` doesn't.

It is not optional for variables because ""`int var;`"" creates an instance of `var`, so if you write `int var;` in two files and try to put them together as a program, there will be two instances of `var` and that's a problem. So you have to say `extern int var;` in one file so the program knows to look for the actual instance of `var` in another file instead of creating an instance of it.

> would this just have the exact same effect of only declaring it once?

Yes.

> Would the program just use whichever declaration that has matching parameters with the definition?

<md>> Is a polynomial created using polynomial\_init meant to have a degree of POLYNOMIAL\_MAXDEG?

The real degree depends on the term of the largest power with a non-zero coefficient. `POLYNOMIAL_MAXDEG` is just an implementation constraint because the `data` array only has 101 elements so our ADT isn’t able to handle polynomials of degrees larger than 100.

There will always be 101 elements in the `data` field, but the polynomial it represents doesn't always have 101 terms/coefficents

<md>re: new line: you are correct in that an extra line (`""\n""`) will be encrypted as well, following the encryption algorithm. This means that an empty line in your plain text results in an empty line in your cipher text, and vice versa.

re: `CRLF`: coming from an [old-fashioned mechanical typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter#/media/File:MEK_II-371.jpg), there are two things that have to happen when moving from one line to the next. (1) the sled (or carriage) that is holding the piece of paper must move from all the way to left to all the way to the right; this is called ""(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return)[carriage return]"" or `CR`. (2) the drum that moves the piece of paper vertically has to advance to the next line; this is called ""[line feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)"" or `LF`. (You can see both `LF` and `CR` in the ASCII table at index `10` and `13` respectively.)

When computer companies tried to figure out how to encode newlines in their operating system, three approaches became common: Linux used `LF`, OSX / macOS `CR`, and Windows both `CR` and `LF` (or `CRLF`). While these details are not visible to the normal user (all they see is the text moving into a new line), they matter when comparing text character-by-character, which is exactly what Marmoset does with your program output and a `.expect`-file.

So, when you are running your program, `LF` (as `\n`) are used for new lines, while our `.expect`-files erroneously used `CRLF` (as `\r\n`). So your output was, for example, ""`Hello\nCS\n136!`"", whereas our `.expect`-file contained ""`Hello\r\nCS\r\n136!`"" As a result, the comparison failed.

Hope this makes sense!</md>"
can we have a &#39;\0&#39; within a comment: ,"<md>The only location where you can have `\0` is at the very end of a string. You can have a buffer with more content after a `\0`, but this content would be ignored since the string ended at the `\0`.

If this were you code:
```
int main(void) {
  trace_msg(""Test""); // printing a test message
}
```
and you had a `\0` after, let's say, the article `a`, your code would actually be read as:
```
int main(void) {
  trace_msg(""Test""); // printing a
```
since the `\0` terminated the string.

Extern Keyword: What is the use of the <strong>extern</strong> keyword as we could use const in the .c and .h file and no error occurs.,Are you sure no error occurs if you have a constant&#39;s declaration in a .h file without the extern keyword? 
DEFINE vs Const: What would be a difference between const and define as we could both to set a non changing value,"<p>A #define is a preprocessor directive and it substitutes the name  with the value/code segment during preprocessing, <strong>before any compilation</strong>. It does this by creating a macro (you can research more about these on your own time). A (global) constant is processed and stored in memory <strong>at compile</strong> <strong>time</strong> (for a constant within a function, you store it in the function&#39;s stack frame when it&#39;s called, just like the memory diagrams we&#39;ve asked you to draw on multiple occasions).</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, when you have something like <code>#define x 5</code>, C will substitute all occurrences of <code>x</code> with 5 <strong>before </strong>the program is compiled and anything is stored in memory. You can think of it like find-and-replace (but it isn&#39;t the exact same, of course). This does mean you can&#39;t treat it exactly like how you can treat a constant - for example, in this scenario, you can&#39;t take the address of <code>x</code> since it isn&#39;t an identifier anymore as soon as the program is preprocessed. </p>
<p></p>
<p>While you can technically create constants using #define, it&#39;s much more powerful than that - try adding <code> #define SQR(x) (x).(x)</code> to some code, and then using <code>SQR</code> like a regular function. Does that work?</p>"

<p>Yes - since a structure you define isn&#39;t a built-in type, C needs to know the details of the type (via a declaration) before you can actually define a constant/variable with that type (a definition).</p>
<p></p>
<p>&gt;  <em>Can extern be omitted for declarations of variables too?</em></p>

".h and .c modularization questions: <p>1. Do .h files need to contain all functions, or can some just appear in .c? If so, would they still be accessible to client?</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. How does linker know which .h and .c files to link together?</p>
<p>It was stated that conventions would encourage that we give them the same name, but it&#39;s not strictly required, so I&#39;m wondering how C knows which header files go with which source files.</p>","<p>&gt; <em>Do .h files need to contain all functions, or can some just appear in .c?</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>No, you don&#39;t need a declaration for every function in your .h file, and you often don&#39;t want to declare every function in your .c file in your .h file. For example, helper functions you write that you don&#39;t want the client to be able to use shouldn&#39;t appear in your .h file. </p>
<p></p>
<p>&gt; <em>If so, would they still be accessible to client?</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>I recommend you try this yourself and find out! Go to one of the exercises and add a simple function to the .c file that prints something to the screen, and then call that function in your main file. Does it work?</p>
<p></p>
<p>&gt; <em>How does linker know which .h and .c files to link together?</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Technically, it doesn&#39;t. When you compile a program, you specify which .c files you want to compile (you actually don&#39;t compile any .h files at all, only .c files - in fact, if/when you take CS 246 you will probably see a very annoying cow that gives you unsolicited advice every time you log in to the student environment, and it often tells you to never ever compile .h files) - take a look at any of the makefiles we provide you in an assignment, it&#39;s only .c files in the MAIN/MODULES part. The compiler converts all the c files into object (.o) files. So, when you include a .h file in a program and try to use a function declared in it, the compiler looks through all the .o files to find a definition. If it cannot find one in any of the compiled files, it gives you an error. You can try this yourself - go to one of our exercises and create a new .h and .c file with some function. Then go to your main file, include the .h file and call the function you just wrote, and then try to run make without changing the makefile (so you&#39;re not telling the compiler to also compile the new .c file you wrote). Does it work, or do you get an error?</p>
<p>TL;DR: It doesn&#39;t - it looks through everything you compiled to see if one of the files have the definition. We (and every programmer who doesn&#39;t want to watch the world burn) give them the same name by convention because it&#39;s easier to find a function definition when you have quite a few .c files.</p>

strcat is not O(1), as it depends on the length of the destination string as well as the length of the source string.

It could be `NULL`, but it doesn't matter. The point is that `remove_after->next` is a valid pointer so we can safely do `remove_after->next->next` and assign `remove_after->next->next` to the `next` pointer of `remove_after`.

> So how do check that the node that's being removed is not the last one?

It could be the last one. Note that the `if` condition checks whether the **next** node exists, if so whether that's the one we want. If the node being removed is the last one, then `remove_after->next` is valid when we are at the second last node, but `itm != remove_after->next->data` is false then it breaks out of the `while` loop. Then we let `to_remove` point at the last node that we want to remove, and make the `next` pointer of the second last node point at the `next` pointer of the last node, which is `NULL`.</md>"

This seems to contradict itself, please correct me if I am wrong. It is true that the queue must have a pointer to the last string stored in it, but why does that make putting Y in it invalid? It's fine to have exactly 50 characters in the queue and the 25th pointer pointing at Y.

What @2552 seems to be asking, which was also asked in several other posts (e.g. @2498, @2449_f1), is what to do if the queue is full, **and there is no ""empty"" slot left in the queue to point at**.

> If we are wrong for this assumption, I require reasoning as to why the pointer to the last element is not present which allows the queue to be full, and I suggest instructions like this be more clear for future assignments, as I do not find this reasoning intuitive.

In this case the pointer to the last element **is** present (and the queue can be full), but not the one to the next element because otherwise it'd be pointing out of the array.</md>"

That only allocates memory for an array of pointers, you'll need to allocate memory for each individual string as well.

> I also dont know why I cant pass `char **` into a `const char **` parameter.

C doesn't let you assign a pointer to a `const` to a pointer to a non-`const`. Consider the following:
```
char arr[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
const char *const_ptr = arr;
```
If you make `const_ptr` a pointer to a `const`, presumably you don't want to mutate elements in `arr` through `const_ptr`.

Then if you do this:
```
char *ptr = const_ptr;
```
You will get an error because letting a non-`const` pointer point at the same thing may cause unintended mutation, which could be potentially dangerous.

The other way around **for single pointer** is fine. You can assign a **single** pointer to a non-`const` to a **single** pointer to a `const` because this is not dangerous.</md>

If we&#39;re taking the &#34;average&#34;, does that mean there could be cases where the actual runtime is larger than the amortized runtime? Please let me know.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>","<md>You are right, we are inconsistent here. 

Amortized run time is useful when you have a function that most of the time is fast but in rare case is slow. So giving the worst case run time may be misleading to a client.

The idea is to (theoretically) take the run time for the slow case and to add it to the run time of the fast cases. If we end up with a (theoretic) constant run time for all cases, we win and we say that the amortized run time is constant.

Amortization is independent of worst/best/average run time; you can do amortization for any kind of run time. Of course, we do it for worst case.</md>"

"Error in Test case?: <p>Hello</p>
<p><br />I am confused by the final insert in simple.in. It seems to break the rules of the program.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The question says: &#34;if an insert operation involves a position in the first half of the sequence, the element currently at this position and its preceding elements are moved forward by one position in the underlying array (only if there is empty space at the beginning of the underlying array).&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, in simple.in, we see this:<br />{X, 22, 11, 44, 55, X, X, X}<br />INSERT 1 77</p>
<p>{22, 77, 11, 44, 55, X, X, X}</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t this break the rule above? position 1 is in the first half of the array, and there is an X.

(oops I thought this was an april fools message since it was similar to some earlier posts sorry)
Maybe talk to the instructors? I’ve heard they have a great sense of humor.
<p>I am sorry it has been taking you this long to do assignments. The assignments in CS136 are certainly challenging but even then they should not be taking you 25 hours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are a number of things that could be the cause. I do not know you. This is not a judgment but simply some things that I have noticed while teaching CS136 (as opposed to second year which I usually teach):</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Do you attend classes? Do you understand the material that has been covered in class? My lectures have mostly been around 70 students but I have 90 registered which means on any given lecture day 20 students are missing. Last week&#39;s attend has been down to almost 50 out of 90 and the material is actually getting harder!</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Do you look over the module&#39;s slides before you even begin the assignment? Do you have a good understanding of the topics that will be needed on the assignment (one again before you even begin). The nice thing about this course is that each assignment covers the topic that was just covered in the previous week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- If you do not understand material in the course notes, do you ask questions during office hours? One thing that has surprised me this term while teaching CS136 (I usually teach CS246 and CS241) is how few students ask non-assignment questions during office hours. The term is almost over and I can count on my fingers how many times I have been asked a question about a course slide. Every question ends up being &#34;here debug my code&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Do you read questions carefully? Do you re-read them before beginning to code? Once again, I am not trying to be judgy but I have seen students rush through assignment specs with only a little understanding of what is actually being asked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Do you try to debug your own code or do you post on piazza and wait for an answer? Piazza is great to let others tell you how to fix your code but that is not as good as figuring out for yourself what was wrong with your code.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Do you search the web for explanations of compiler errors and try to understand why your code is not compiling? This goes hand in hand with debugging. We live in a world where answers to most compiler errors for C programs is a click away. You just have to ask your favourite search engine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Do you write your own tests or just rely on the simple tests instructors provide? I have seen students aim to just get the public tests to pass. Then they are surprised that some/many of the secret tests failed. The public tests are meant to give you an example of the expected requirements. They certainly do not take care of more complex cases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond this, I will say that everyone is different. For some, it takes longer to learn to code. I was one of them! I had a horrible time in my 1A term where I was introduced to C&#43;&#43; programming. I still have nightmares! But look at me now. I did a PhD in programming languages. It took time, but I got it (2A was when I actually started enjoying programming). Hang in there.</p>"

"Assignment 9 confusion: <p>I have several questions about assignment 9.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1: What does size_t mean? Is it a brand new data type that represents the size of other types of data? The slides never explain what this is. <br /><br />2: In the provided col_node ADT, the function</p>
<div>struct col_node *cnode_create(const void *obj, size_t obj_size)<br />is difficult to understand. I presume that obj_size is meant to be the size of obj in bytes, but what is obj meant to be? What purpose does it serve?<br /><br />3: In the collector.h documentations, collector_init provides the following example:<br />
<div>
<div>example: collector_make(sizeof(struct posn), print_posn) creates a collector</div>
<div>// for storing struct posn.<br />Where did collector_make come from? Is it another function I have to make myself?<br /><br />4: I can be certainly sure that the provided
<div>col_node is a Linked Data Type. I might be totally dumb but why is the destroy function nothing but this:<br /><br />
<div>
<div>void cnode_destroy(struct col_node *cn) {</div>
<div>assert(cn);</div>
<div>free(cn-&gt;data);</div>
<div>free(cn);</div>
<div>}<br /><br />Shouldn&#39;t we recursively free the elements from cn-&gt;next too?</div>
</div>
</div>
<br /><br />I already read the slides carefully to try and answer these questions myself, but it was difficult to understand the assignment even with the slides. This especially includes my 2nd question. <br /><br />I appreciate anyone who can help me with this.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p> </p>","<md>1. You don't have to worry about it, but FYI `size_t` is an unsigned (i.e., cannot be negative) integer type that's used to represent the size of objects in bytes.

2. > I presume that `obj_size` is meant to be the size of `obj` in bytes

    Yes.

    > but what is `obj` meant to be? What purpose does it serve?

    It is a pointer that points to the object about to be inserted into the collector. It's a `void *` so you can create a collector node that stores anything.

3. That should be `collector_init`, thanks for pointing out! Feel free to pull the updated version (you don't have to because that's just comments)

4. `cnode_destroy` only destroys one node, you'd have to use it to destroy all the nodes in the collector.</md>"

Also... why does it pass? llst isn&#39;t pointing to anything right?</p>","malloc could fail due to not enough space in the heap, the assertion is to check if the malloc fail or not.

<p>Hi, in this expected output of Q2A sequence, when you are entering an element into an empty array, at top we get 1/2 element, but at the bottom we get 1/1. I think this is wrong , so how do i put a regrade request</p>

<p>In the second case, we have a max length of 2 that gets shrinked once the last element is removed to a max length of 1, so it shows 1/1 when the next item gets inserted.</p>

Session 11 slides: What does &#34;describe the memory management issues related to using void pointers in ADTs&#34; refer to?<br />Would appreciate an example,"Since you don&#39;t know the exact type of the data you&#39;re storing (since you&#39;re just storing them as void pointers) you can&#39;t really free the data in a generic manner. One way we get around this is by storing a destructor for the data type in our ADT - we did this in the generic array example in the slides. That example stored strings in the array so the destructor basically just freed them, but if you were storing a generic array of linked lists for example, simply calling free would lead to a memory leak - you&#39;d have to free all the nodes and then the list, like in M10. The special considerations for freeing space (and sometimes allocating, depending on the exact details of your implementation, but it mostly comes up with freeing) the data stored in your generic ADT implemented with void pointers causes would be a memory management issue."

"Assignment 9 Q2 Random Test On Marmoset: <p>Hi there,</p>

<p>I think there should be an error here in the testing of assignment 9 Question 2 as it shows that there is &#34;&lt;/D9oFS&gt;&#34;. I believe this is wrong syntax because we have seen no open tag for this before this line (I have used CTRL &#43; F to find but there is none other than this close tag). And if some may say this can be a content then according to XML rule from the question 1b, a content cannot have the opening and close tag (&#34;&lt;&#34; and &#34;&gt;&#34;).

"Do string literals take up memory forever?: <p>it says in the slide that when we use string literals, the program essentially creates a string in the read-only memory (literal pool), and using the string literal is really just using a pointer to that string in the read-only memory. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe I am misunderstanding, but I feel like this seems the same as a memory leak, if we use a lot of string literals, would the literal pool just be clogged with a bunch of arrays of these strings, and they would not go away? Is this just usually not a problem to worry about in programs?</p>","No, I think they will be freed by the compiler after the execution of the program.
<md>Yes, those literals are there permanently, until your program terminates.

But that's OK; each literal can exist only once.  So the amount of memory used by literals is $$O(n)$$ where $$n$$ is the size of your program.

The problem with a memory leak is that you can leak a little, then a little more, then more, and more\.... There is no bound on the amount leaked.

---

BTW, when your program terminates, all leaked memory is freed.  It doesn't stick around.

Memory use can grow and grow, eventually requiring a reboot.  But that is only because some long-lived process continues to use memory.  If you can identify, kill, and then restart the appropriate process, you can avoid rebooting indefinitely.

The only exception to this is if there is a memory leak in the kernel.</md>

In an exam, it’s always nice to assert pointer parameters in functions that cannot take `NULL` pointers, and make sure to assert any requirements if a function is documented and has a requires section.

Also, if you were required to assert that the initial pointers are not `NULL`, then you could have the function just assert the requirement and pass the pointers to a helper function that does the actual work.</md>

<p></p>
<p>The thing in the corner does not indicate the correct answer.  It took me a while to figure that out.</p>
<p>My guess at this (and one of the professors is welcome to correct me) but I think the &#34;elements&#34; are the labels at the start of each line on the frame. The generated frame for the code would look something like this:</p>

<p></p>
<p>Alternatively, the question was asking you to generate the stack for ALL information on the slide, which perhaps means we are supposed to put the global variable on the stack (even though we don&#39;t normally do this). This also is not a fully satisfying answer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The answer could also be wrong. I think its a perfectly fine interpretation to say 5 instead, as there are 5 distinct VALUES on the stack.</p>"

<md>The student answer gets at this, but to reiterate: you cannot dereference a `void *`.  But if your `void *` is pointing at an array, you can do arithmetic on that array, and you would do this arithmetic using the `sizeof` the items in the array.

Notice also that `data[i]` is equivalent to `*(data + i)`.  It has a ""hidden"" deference.

If I&#39;ll be doing lots of inserting/deleting, linked lists would be fast. If I&#39;m doing lots of searching and the order doesn&#39;t matter, a BST seems right. Then, I&#39;d add the fields relevant to my data structure (e.g. array would need a length and a capacity depending on if you&#39;re doing any dynamic allocation, linked list would need a front, BST would need a root, etc.). Then, I start implementing the functions I want to give my client - depending on what they are, I may see the need arise for some more fields, e.g. if I&#39;m storing stuff in a linked list and my client repeatedly needs to know its length, I may add that as a field.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TLDR: decide what data structure you want to use - to implement those you&#39;ll need some fields in order for it to work correctly. Then, start implementing the ADT functions you&#39;ll provide to the client - depending on how you&#39;re doing them/how you&#39;re optimizing your code, you may need some more fields that you can add as you go.

<md>One situation you might like to compare pointers: using a pointer to walk through an array.  For example,

    void print_backwards(const char *s) {
      const char *p = s + strlen(s) - 1;
      while (p >= s) {
        printf(""%c"", *p);

    int main(void) {
      print_backwards(""foobar"");

Start with a pointer pointing at the last character.  Keep moving it left until it gets before the start.

Of course you could do it with an `int` counter.  But the pointer version is arguably more elegant.</md>"

What&#39;s the difference between a statement and an expression?: How would you define and/or differentiate between statements and expressions in C?,"<md>An expression is a piece of code that can be evaluated to have a value; if you're talking about an expression, you probably care about the value of the expression.  E.g. `3 + 4` has the value `7`.

A statement is a piece of code that can be executed to cause some side effect.  If you're talking about a statement, you probably care about the side effect of the statement.  E.g. given this

    void inc(int *n) { (*n)++; }

then `inc(x)` is a statement; it has a side effect of incrementing `x`.

---

In C, most statements are also expressions.  For example, `printf(""foo"")` has the side effect of printing something on the screen.  But it's also an expression, and the value of this expression is `3`.  Also `x++` has the side effect of incrementing `x`, but it's also an expression, and the value of this expression is the old value of `x`.</md>"

<p>We can change the intcmp code to which is similar to the alphacmp code. I seem to recall now that the generic algorithms such as qsort requires the things you are comparing to be const - thus the char * const.</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
int intcmp (const void *a, const void *b) {
    int const *a1 = a;
    int const *b1 = b;
    return *a1 - *b1;

"ADTs using Linked Lists vs Dynamic Arrays: <p>Hello,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have been reading through the ADT definitions and am a little confused on why we would implement a Queue using Dynamic arrays now that we have linked lists. In fact, for many of the ADTs we have gone over linked lists seem superior?</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the queue:</p>
<p>- We don&#39;t need to worry about individually shifting each element when we dequeue. We just link the wrapper structure head to the second element and then we are done.</p>
<p>- By using a back pointer augmentation we can easily enqueue, and don&#39;t need to worry about doubling/amortizing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Similarly, I can see a lot of reasons to use linked lists for the sequence and stack ADTs. For a stack, a simple length/back pointer augmentation on the Linked list would solve a lot of problems. I can see the array&#39;s O(1) indexing being very useful for the sequence, however.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It feels like a trade off between time and code simplicity. I just imagine implementing the sequence&#43;&#43; from assignment 8 using a linked list, and it seems much more cleaner, even if we lose the runtime advantages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In short, why would we ever use an array for queue (and other ADTs) now that we have linked lists? Will you force us to use arrays even if they are (subjectively) worse?</p>","<md>An array is *contiguous* in memory.

Modern hardware (like since, oh, 1960) has a [CPU cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache), that makes accessing contiguous memory faster.  A cache is a kind of extra-fast memory. You ask for the item at address `p`, and it gets it, but also loads `p+1, p+2, p+3, ... p+2048` into cache, so next time it can get it faster.

That doesn't work with linked lists since things can be spread around memory.

Also, consider: to store an array of 100 `char` values, I need to store 1 `char *` (size 8), an `int` (size 4), and 100 `char` values.  So 112 `char` values in total.  If I do the same using a linked list, for each value I need to store a `char *` to the next, as well as the value itself.  So 908 `char` values in total.

Which do you prefer to spend: 908, or 112?</md>"
"Runtime on &#34;bounded&#34; data: <p>Hi,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I remember this was brought up on earlier assignments, and I wanted to ask for more clarification. Typically, when we have data like an array, or a linked list, we write our runtime in terms of the length of the data as a variable &#39;n&#39;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However I remember that we made an argument that if we knew the data was &#34;bounded&#34;, then the runtime of a loop which processes that data is technically O(1), since we know that, at max, said loop can only run as many times as the data is bounded.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>My question is in which scenarios is this argument applicable?</strong> If we had an oversized array which held 100 items max, could iterating through that be considered O(n)? What about a binary tree where the height is limited to a certain number?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>","I would say that the argument applies in any situation where you can get a bound on the data. The point of Big O notation is to observe the performance of the program as the datasets get REALLY BIG, so if no matter how big the dataset gets, it&#39;s always gonna be under a certain O(constant), then it&#39;s fine to define as constant time.

"how to distinguish assertion, assumption and condition in questions?: While questions state requirements of arguments (e.g. x = 10), I sometimes cannot identify if the question asked to assert the requirements (i.e. assert(x == 10)), or it is assuming inputs (i.e. things other than 10 cannot be inputed in x), or we should consider it in coding (i.e. if (x == 10) {...} else {...}).","I think usually if a question says something like &#34;x has to be greater than y&#34;, then you should for sure assert(x &gt; y).

1. Doesn’t matter what func() is, all that matters to us is its efficiency which is given. Its O(n^2) because, func() is in O(n) time. The for loop above repeats n amount of times. So we’d have O(n) n times or in other words O(n) x n = O(n^2)<div><br /></div><div>2. ln(len) tells us that our for loop is not repeating n times like above. This time it’s some sort of logarithmic iteration. Then we know it repeat logn times. The inner loop repeats n times as we can see. The code within the inner loop is of O(1). Now if we back track we have:</div><div><br /></div><div>O(1) * O(n) * O(logn). You tell me what the time efficiency is!</div><div><br /></div><div>3. Not necessarily. You have the right idea where if we are iterating anything not n times but a fraction of it, it will be log(some base)n. I just don’t think it applies all the time.</div><div><br /></div><div>4. Not sure what you mean by function recursion, but if you look in that module, you can see how recursion is calculated. It will be different in different cases, 2^n is typically for COMPLEX recursion. Accumalative also depends on the code, you can see more examples in the module.</div><div><br /></div><div>5. Let’s break it down:</div><div><br /></div><div>Inner Code: O(1)</div><div>Inner Loop: Repeats n amount of times so we have O(1) * O(n) = O(n) (I say n but it’s i or j time) </div><div>Outer Loop: Repeats n amount of times (again I say n only because it’s not getting fractionalized but it’s some amount of times) so we have O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Hopefully that all helps!</div>"

<p>Do swap values within an array you swap the addresses of the values. I was wondering a few things </p>

<p>2. When you swap the addresses of the values, how does the array change order as I thought that the addresses of the elements in an array are in consecutive order? </p>","<md>Your swap function, as written, does nothing.

Let's imagine that you call it with `0x1111`, and `0x2222`, each of which is a pointer to an `int`.  Imagine that the contents of `0x1111` is `1000` and the contents of `0x2222` is `2000`.

Then:

1. `temp` gets the value of `0x1111`.
2. `val1` gets the value of `0x2222`.
3. `val2` gets the value of `0x1111`.

But at not point did we change anything outside the function.  This function does nothing.

---

Possibly you meant to write something like this:

    void swap(int *val1, int *val2){
      int temp = *val1;
      *val1 = *val2;
      *val2 = temp;
    }

Imagine again that you call it with `0x1111`, and `0x2222`, each of which is a pointer to an `int`.  Imagine that the contents of `0x1111` is `1000` and the contents of `0x2222` is `2000`.

1. `temp` get the value from slot `0x1111`, which is 1000.
2. the slot `0x1111` gets the value from slot `0x2222`, which is 2000.
3. the slot `0x2222` gets the value 1000.

This function has successfully swapped the values between slots `0x1111` and `0x2222`.</md>"

"Printing strings from a void * array: <p>Hi,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was trying to print an array of strings passed as a void *, but the only way it works is if I cast in the print_str function. I am not sure why I need to do this for strings, but not ints and chars. I appreciate the help.</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
void print_str(const void *str) {
    /*const char **str_str = str;
    printf(&#34;%s\n&#34;, *str_str); */ // Does not work, gives following error:

  /* initializing &#39;const char **&#39; with an expression of type &#39;const void *&#39; discards qualifiers [-Wincompatible-pointer-types-discards-qualifiers]
*/

    const char **str_str = (const char **)str; // works with cast
    printf(&#34; %s &#34;, *str_str);
}

void print_garr(void *arr, size_t size, const int arr_len, void (*print)(const void *)) {
    printf(&#34;[&#34;);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr_len; &#43;&#43;i) {
        print(arr &#43; i * size);
    }
    printf(&#34;]\n&#34;);
}

int main() {

 // Example array of strings
    char *arr[] = {&#34;Hello&#34;, &#34;World&#34;, &#34;Custom&#34;, &#34;Print&#34;, &#34;Function&#34;};

    // Call the print function passing the array and the custom print function
    print_garr(arr, sizeof(char *), 5, print_str); 

}</pre>",This is because const void * is a pointer to a constant but const char** is a pointer to a pointer to a constant. Const void * can be thought as A-&gt; B and B is constant while const char** is A-&gt;B-&gt;C and C is constant. This cause issues cause &#34;discards qualifiers&#34; issues cause now B is defined differently.

On the line where they reallocate the memory, the mutated address (0x88) is solely for the str in the exclaim function (it doesn&#39;t change the address of the str in main), so when str is changed from 0x80 to 0x88, the str in main is still pointing to 0x80, which is ultimately freed and would lead to the error. i hope this makes sense</p>

<p></p>
<p>For instance on (a), you can say something like the outer loop will run $$n$$ times where $$n$$ is the length of the string, and since we have strlen in the check, each time it runs it will be $$O(n)$$ from the strlen check, and $$O(n)$$ (or less) from the nested loop, so overall it will be $$O(n^2)$$</p>
