Question,Answer
Mobius in French: This isn&#39;t really a math-related question but the UI of the Mobius website is in French and there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to change it. The lessons are still in English and I speak French but it&#39;s just kind of annoying and I was wondering if it was happening for anyone else or just me. Also wanted to know if there was a way to switch it.,"Try changing the preferred language list in your browser to have English at the top. For Chrome it can be accessed at chrome://settings/languages .
I have something similar actually, except for me my UI is in Chinese. I think it might have to do with where you got your computer from? Because although my computer has English as its display language, I got it from China so that might explain the Chinese UI. Currently, I haven&#39;t found any way to change it. I actually also had this issue with the CEMC software back in high school too."
"Bonus Quizzes: <p>As for the bonus quizzes, is it better for us to do them now or wait until we learn enough from the course?</p>

<p>When navigating LEARN I saw that I could access MA01 from the Mobius links section in the content browser. When I clicked on it I was taken to a pre-test screen. Is this one of the 10 Mobius Assignments? How do I know what material is covered on it? Also, do the marks from these Mobius assignments count towards the &#34;Mobius Quizzes&#34; or &#34;Written Assignments&#34; component on the course outline?

"Due Dates for Mobius Quizzes: <p>Hello, I was wondering firstly if Mobius assignments are referred to as Mobius quizzes and if they mean the same thing. If so, I&#39;m also confused what the course outline meant specifically by &#34;The deadline for Mobius quizzes is always 00:01 AM (EDT or EST).&#34; Does this mean, for example, if the deadline for MA 1 is Tuesday, Sept 12, that I should complete it the moment Tuesday starts at 12:00 am or Wednesday Sept 12:00 am?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sorry another question too, could you clarify what this means also in the course outline?</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#34;Mobius quizzes will be available for 24 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays starting on Monday, September 13th and ending on Monday, December 6th&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If I&#39;m interpreting this right, Mobius quizzes/MA&#39;s will not be available on Tuesdays, Thursday and weekends? And if our first MA is due Sept 12, why is the start date on the 13th.</p>

"Do we need to justify our proofs of a set of numbers existing which meet a certain specification?: <p>For questions which ask to prove there exists a set of numbers that meet a certain specification, such as in WA1, Question 1b, do we need to justify our answer or can we just provide a set of numbers which meet the specification?

"Question about Negation of a statement: <p>What is the negation of &#34;This statement is TRUE?&#34;</p>
<p>Since &#34;The statement is FALSE&#34; is a paradox and cannot be regarded as a statement, what should the negation of &#34;This statement is TRUE&#34; be, or it is simply not a statement?</p>","<p>A very interesting question that was asked in my lecture this morning - I sent an email to my classlist, but I assume you are not in my section. Here&#39;s the email I sent:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#34;My takeaways are that (1) the word &#34;This&#34; in both sentences refer to different things, so they aren&#39;t actually negations of each other; and (2) the sentence is a &#34;reverse paradox&#34; in the sense that the reader can assign a truth value to &#34;This statement is true.&#34;, and either choice is consistent, but no truth value is forced by the sentence itself.&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>To answer the question in the title, I think the negation would be something like &#34;The negation of &#34;This statement is true&#34; is true&#34;. We don&#39;t change the domain when we negate statements, so &#34;this&#34; should refer to the same thing before and after negation (thanks to Peter for pointing this out!).</p>"
What does it mean by “Do not use the notation P(n)” in WA1 Q1: Hi I was just wondering if anyone could explain what does it mean by not using the P(n) notation? Would it mean I can’t express the mathematical statement using such letters? <div><br /></div>,"What it means here is recall P(n): $$n$$ can be written as a sum of four perfect cubes.

So do not write the statement in symbols by writing, for example,  if the quantifier is a universally quantified statement and domain in S,  Then you have something like,

$$\forall n \in S, P(n)$$. Just expressing your open sentence as $$P(n)$$ is what you are told to avoid. Rather use the definition `` $$n$$ can be written as a sum of four perfect cubes&#39;&#39; and write that in symbols."

<p></p>
<p>$$\exists x\epsilon \mathbb{Z}, \forall y\epsilon \mathbb{R}, x+y=0$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Does this mean, &#34;Is there an explicit value of x that will make the equation true for all values of y&#34;? In other words, can we let x=-y to make the equation true or that wouldn&#39;t work in this situation?</p>","This wouldn&#39;t work because x is being chosen first,  and then you have to make sure x &#43; y = 0 no matter what y you choose to go along with that x.
<p>The student answer is great. Think of the quantified variables as being chosen by players in a game. In your example, $$x$$ is being chosen first, then $$y$$, because of the order of the quantifiers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now notice which quantifiers they are - existential first, then universal. Thus we would interpret this as “there exists an $$x$$ that works for all $$y$$”. Hopefully this helps you verify the truth or falsehood of the statement now.</p>"

"Question on Open Sentences: <p>Hello! </p>
<p>I had a question on open sentences. I know that an open sentences are expressions that can be dependent on n number of variables, and these variables are within P(x1,x2,x3..). However I was wondering can open sentences have can have several variables  but in P(x1,x2...) only few are actually stated. </p>
<p></p>
<p>To be more precise, if i were to stay let P(X): x^2 = y, would that be considered an open sentence? Y is still a variable even if P(X) is defined or would it have to be P(x,y).</p>
<p></p>
<p>If it has to be P(x,y) would it be safe to assume that if P(x) is an open sentence that sentence only has one variable?    </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you</p>","<p>It has to be $$P(x, y) \colon x^2 = y$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So you are correct: when one writes $$P(x)$$, this means that the open sentence $$P$$ depends on exactly one variable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here&#39;s an exercise for you. Let $$P(x, y)$$ be the open sentence $$x^2 = y$$. Determine if each of the following is</p>
<ul><li><em>a true statement</em></li><li><em>a false statement</em></li><li>an <em>open sentence that depends on x</em></li><li><em>an open sentence that depends on y</em></li><li><em>an open sentence that depends on both $$x$$ and $$y$$</em></li><li><em>neither an open sentence nor a statement</em></li></ul>
<p>(a) $$P(x, y)$$</p>
<p>(b) $$P(x, 5)$$</p>
<p>(c) $$P(3, y)$$</p>
<p>(d) $$\exists x \in \mathbb R, P(x, y)$$</p>
<p>(e) $$\forall y \in \mathbb Q, P(x, y)$$</p>
<p>(f) $$\exists y \in \mathbb Z, P(-3, y)$$</p>
<p>(g) $$\forall x \in \mathbb Q, P(x, 4)$$</p>
I believe that P(X): x^2 = y would not be an open sentence because there is no way to evaluate if it&#39;s true or false, given that the value of y is not given in the function."
MA assignments: I have a question about the marking scheme for Mobius assignments. I can see on mobius that it says I have 2 trials total per assignment.

<p>Also an important thing is that you read from left to right whenever dealing with statements. This was mentioned in 1.5 of the Mobius textbook. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In english the statement states &#34;for all rational numbers p, there is an integer z for $$|p-q|\leq 1$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because the domain for p is all rational numbers which are all integers and/or numbers that can be written as a fraction ex: $$8/4$$ and there is an integer q which makes the following open sentence less than or equal to 1. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So if we took p as any rational number 36/6 and hence $$|(36/6) - q| \leq 1$$, we can then take an integer for q such as 6 itself to fit the open sentence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Therefore giving us $$|(36/6) - 6|\leq 1 = |6 -6|\leq 1$$ and hence $$0\leq 1$$ which is true. Hope this helped.</p>

<p>Can I think the open sentence as a sentence that contains at least one variable that has not been assigned with a domain? But once that variable has been assigned with a specific domain (E.g. x belongs to real number / x = 5 / x&gt;1 etc.), then it becomes a statement.</p>

Difference between quantifying versus fixing a variable: In class we learned that we can turn an open sentence into a statement by quantifying or fixing the variable(s). But what exactly is the difference between quantifying and fixing?,"I would need to see how your professor introduced &#34;fixing&#34; a variable, but I would guess that quantifying a variable involves turning an open sentence like &#34;x &#43; 2 = 3&#34; into a statement like &#34;There is a natural number x such that x &#43; 2 = 3,&#34; but fixing a variable means giving a particular value for the unspecified variable x. For example, when x = 1, the sentence becomes &#34;1 &#43; 2 = 3&#34; which is now a true statement. In the latter case we have &#34;fixed&#34; a particular value of the variable. "
Quantifier for the term &#34;arbitrary&#34;: While looking at Mobius there were a couple statements that used the term &#34;arbitrary&#34; to refer to a value (e.g. &#34;an arbitrary real number x&#34;). What quantifier matches the word &#34;arbitrary&#34; ? Is it sometimes existential and sometimes universal? Many of us are confused so we were wondering how we can tell.,"<p>&#34;Arbitrary&#34; usually means &#34;any,&#34; and translates symbolically to a statement involving the quantifier $$\forall$$. For example, the following statements mean the same thing: <br /><br />``For an arbitrary integer x, x &lt; x&#43;1&#34;</p>
<p><br />``$$\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}$$, x &lt; x&#43;1&#34; </p>

"Questions about lessons so far: <p>I have a few questions from the lessons we&#39;ve had so far. </p>
<p>1. How do we identify a the quantifier, domain, variable and open sentence in a statement (with words)?</p>
<p>     eg. &#34;x^2 &#43; 2x - 3 = 0 has a real solution&#34; and &#34;Every natural number can be expressed as the product of two integers&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. With nested quantifiers, I know the order of the quantifiers matter but how so? Also, does a specific order usually mean the statement is true or false? </p>
<p>     eg. if you have two quantifiers, and the first one is &#34;for all&#34; and the second one is &#34;there is at least&#34;, doesn&#39;t this mean that the statement would probably be true (in most cases)?</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. In our notes, we wrote (in symbols) &#34; For all x in the set s, p(x)&#34;. I&#39;m confused as to how this is a statement when we haven&#39;t defined p(x) yet? Isn&#39;t p(x) it&#39;s own function?(eg. shouldn&#39;t this be an open statement?)</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Is there a difference between a statement vs a quantified statement?</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Does each quantifier (in nested quantifiers) have it owns/is associated with its own variables and domain?</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. When converting a statement into symbols, is there a comma or period mark at the end of the statement?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>","<p>1.  Write the equivalent symbolic statement, then it should be clear which each of the parts are.</p>
<p>2.  The order of the quantifiers will most likely affect the truth value of the statement.  The second part of your question here can&#39;t really be answered. It depends on the open sentence you are considering. </p>
<p>3.  It&#39;s difficult to talk about the general form of statements.  But yes, you are correct that if we don&#39;t know what $$P(x)$$ is, then technically it&#39;s an open sentence because the sentence depends on the choice of $$P(x)$$.</p>
<p>4.  A quantified statement is one which has quantifiers as a part of it.  But not all statements have quantifiers.  For example, $$2=3$$ is a false statement that doesn&#39;t involve quantifiers.</p>
<p>5.  Each variable in a statement will have its own domain and its own quantifier. </p>
<p>6.  You don&#39;t need punctuation at the end of a symbolic statement. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>1. x^2 &#43;2x-3=0 is the open sentence, as the variable is undefined</p>
<p>    the quantifier is ∃ because it says it has &#34;a&#34; meaning only one</p>
<p>    the domain is the real numbers as it mentions</p>
<p>    the variable is x</p>
<p>2. it depends on the statement </p>
<p>3. no, this is a general statement, x is defined to be in the set of S, and p(x) is what p is at x</p>
<p>4. a quantified statement has a quantifier, domain, variable and open sentence</p>
<p>5. if a quantifier is needed, it can be added for how many ever variables you have</p>
<p>6. there&#39;s a comma after each variable has been assigned to a set</p>"

For example, let A and B be statements. If they have the same truth values then the statement is always true. 

Also, If the hypothesis is False, then no matter what the conclusion is the statement is always True. 

You only get a false statement when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is False."

"Difference between Counter Example and Contradiction: <p>I am confused about counter example and contradiction.

<p>To me the method being used could either be contradiction or counter example. As the textbook mentioned, it is finding certain value, thus the method is counter example. But if I assume the statement is correct, then it should apply to all values a,b,c,x,y. But then assigning certain value to a,b,c,x,y, I find the implication fails. Isn&#39;t that a contradiction?</p>

<p>It is contradiction since I am assuming the statement is true and get 1 &lt; 1/2. But during that process, I have assigned epsilon with the value 1/2 to break the assumption. Isn&#39;t that a counter example?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks for the answer in advance!</p>","<p>Proof by contradiction is a method to prove that a statement is true. </p>
<p>We assume that the negation of the statement we are trying to prove is true and then we show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.  Therefore, the negation can&#39;t be true (ie it&#39;s false) and so the original statement is true. </p>

Shouldn&#39;t the correct proof be the backward of this proof?</p>",<md>It's correct because all the steps are reversible (using iff). You're not assuming the conclusion because all the statements are conditional.</md>
"EP3 Q32 - Is this proof valid?: <p>I tried the last question on EP 3: <img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flkqwdweou4p2j4%2F4feedc11381b1d73ce077266ee05ddc432e984a1942dae14ec0d88ca32a72149%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.png"" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>but I am not sure if my solution is correct (also I am very new to modular arithmetic):</p>
<p></p>
<p>Assume in a right triangle that both sides a, b are not divisible by 3, so a = b = &#43;-1 mod 3.</p>
<p>so a^2 = b^2 = 1 mod 3 and c^2 = a^2 &#43; b^2 so c^2 = -1 mod 3.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But c^2 = -1 mod 3 is not possible because c^2 mod 3 = (c mod 3)^2 which would translate to -1 = (c mod 3)^2 (c mod 3 would be &#43;- i)</p>
<p></p>
<p>(this is a contradiction)</p>","<md>The reasoning is correct. You just need to tidy-up the notation. Note that the congruence relation is not defined for complex numbers, so I wouldn't say $$c \equiv \pm i \pmod 3$$. A better way to say the same thing is since $$c \equiv \pm 1 \pmod 3$$, $$c^2 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$$ which contradicts the result above.</md>

Disproving implications: Do we disprove an implication by directly giving a counter-example?,"<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>yes you can use a counter example to try and disprove any universally quantified statement - this is the instructor&#39;s answer</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Check out the truth table for a general implication $$A\Rightarrow B$$. It’s only false if $$A$$ is true but $$B$$ is false.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So the general strategy to disprove an implication is to assume the hypothesis and disprove the conclusion, e.g. by proving the negation of the conclusion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the conclusion you’re trying to disprove is a universal statement, then sure, you can use a counterexample.</p>

"which step is incorrect while disproving universally quantified statement: Hi, if someone gives examples while disproving a universally quantified statement, I think the step of stating example is incorrect. But the mobius link question said it is correct until it get to the wrong result of the example. ","To disprove a universally  quantified statement you give an example called a counter-example which shows the open sentence is false.  We take this approach because the negation of $$\forall x \in S,  P(x)$$ is $$\exists x \in S, \neg P(x)$$."
WA3 Q3: Can we use the coursebook to prove the implication. To be exact I want to use similar wording shown in example 8. I am not sure if that would be against the rules.  ,Mimicking solutions from the course notes is permitted.  Try to internalize the solution by putting things in your own words. 
"How do we show that we disproven a statement?: <p>Hi I was doing the exercises from class, and I found out the statement was false.

<p>Hi, I am confused about the step where they start with (k&#43;1)^2. It&#39;s very hard to read since everything is on one line. But where are they using the inductive hypothesis (k^2 &gt; 2k&#43;1) and using that to show P(k&#43;1)? I can see that they are expanding (k&#43;1)^2  but how are they showing that it is greater than 2(k&#43;1)&#43;1 using the inductive hypothesis? Sorry, it&#39;s just very hard to follow their example with everything on one line. <em>I&#39;d appreciate it if you can explain each step.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>I really appreciate any help you can provide. </p>","<p>$$(k+1)^{2} = k^{2}+2k+1$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>And we know this is larger than $$(2k+1)+(2k+1)$$ since $$k \geq 3$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>And we know that $$(2k+1) \geq 7$$, since again $$k \geq 3$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>So we can replace one $$(2k+1)$$ with 7 and state:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$(2k+1)+(2k+1)\geq (2k+1)+7$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next we know:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$(2k+1)+7=2k+8\geq 2k+3$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$2k+3=2(k+1)+1$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$(k+1)^{2} > 2(k+1)+1$$</p>
<p></p>

Assignment Length: How long should an assignment typically take for the average student? Just curious.,"I think the assignments generally take at least a few hours to do and probably on some range like 3-15 hours depending how much trouble you are having with a particular assignment. For me personally, it also takes up a lot of time to check my work

"EP4 Q9 - is this proof correct?: <p>For the tower of hanoi puzzle, working out the first few cases i guessed that a formula for the least amount of moves for a tower of n pegs is 2^n - 1. Is this way of proving it inductively correct?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Base case of 2 since it can be done in 3 moves but not in two</p>
<p></p>
<p>Assume least moves for a pillar of k height </p>
<p></p>
<p>For a pillar with k&#43;1 height, before the largest peg at the bottom of the tower can be moved, the pillar of height k ontop of it needs to be all moved onto another single peg, which takes 2^k - 1 moves by our inductive hypothesis. Now we can take 1 move to move the biggest block to the other remaining peg, and now we want to move the tower of k height onto the biggest peg. Since the peg is the biggest peg, it will not block anything we try to put on it. The minimum moves to move the tower of k onto another peg is again k^2 - 1 by our hypothesis, so the total amount of moves for a height of k&#43;1 = 2^k &#43; 2^k &#43; 1 - 1 - 1 = 2^(k&#43;1) - 1</p>",You have a little typo where you write k^2-1 when you meant 2^k-1 but I think this looks good.

POSI vs POMI: Is there any tip for choosing which one to use when doing induction proving?,"<p>It all depends on your proof of the inductive conclusion, $$P(k+1)$$.  What do you need to be true to prove it?  If you only need $$P(k)$$ to be true to prove it, then POMI will suffice.  If you need $$P(i)$$ to be true for some value of $$i$$ which is less than $$k$$, then you will need to use POSI. </p>
<p></p>

"Disproving Implication: I noticed that disproving implications wasn&#39;t in the textbook, will this be something we should expect on the test?","Well, you were taught how to disprove either universally quantified statements or existentially quantified statements. 

if the statement is of the form  $$\forall x \in S, p(x) \implies q(x)$$ 
you should be able to disprove this based on concepts learned in class. As mentioned everything from Week 1-4 is to be reviewed before your test.  So that is to be expected in the test.

Also, I think the textbook discusses this concept of using the fact that the implication is false if the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false or just prove the negation is true."

"WA3 Q2b (warrants a regrade?): Say for this question we started off by disproving the possibility of k=1 and k=2 by providing an a for which the statement proves false. And then after considered both the even and odd case for k and gave an a for which the statement proves false for these cases too. To be more specific, when k is even and a is even also, the result is even, and therefore not prime. And when k is odd and a is the cube of k, the result is a multiple of (2k&#43;1) and is therefore again not prime. Basically the point of this method would be to prove that k fails when both even and odd and therefore no such positive integer k exists. Would this be a valid proof? Like granted it’s definitely not efficient; I looked at the solution and I definitely get how that proof is better, it’s just that I don’t get why this proof wouldn’t work?

"Question From Test Practice in Lecture: <p>Hi,</p>
<p></p>
<p>For question 5 from the Practice Questions given in lecture for Test 1, I was wondering if there was a better way to prove the question than what I came up with.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How I thought of solving this question was to disprove the negation, to show how the original statement is true. And then I used the contradiction on the negation of the statement that assume there does exist p and q (integers) s.t. p^2-q^2 = 10. Here, I noticed that it was a diff of squares so I split it into (p&#43;q)(p-q) = 10. Then I have the potential test cases (since it can be positive or negative, 1 and 10, or 2 and 5 as well as other way around). And then after solving for the cases, I keep getting that q is not an integer and then I use that as a contradiction to show the negation must be false and the original statement is true. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As you can tell, this is pretty long and exhaustive, so I was wondering if there was nice, shorter way to prove this.</p>

This might not be of much help but I think to prove it the first way, you can say (using the definition of divisibility) that since a divides b, there exists some integer k that when multiplied with a, yields b. And in the same way you can say that since b divides a, there exists some integer k’ that when multiplied with b yields a. And then using this fact you can substitute a with b (k’) into your second equation, and you should get b(k)(k’)=b. And then divide both sides by b, and you get k(k’)=1. Which means the only possible integers that work are 1 and -1, and that means if you look back at the first two statements that say a(k)=b and b(k’)=a then a has to be &#43;/- b."

<p>Also, I understand, a=2 and a=10 are impossible as they contradict the assumption of hypothesis we made first. Since 2 and 10 are impossible, do they make whole statement false or they just make conclusion false (as a = 2 or a= 10 means a is neither 1 or 5) hence make whole statement false?</p>
Also, I understand, a=2 and a=10 are impossible as they contradict the assumption of hypothesis we made first. Since 2 and 10 are impossible, do they make whole statement false or they just make hypothesis false hence make whole implication true?
<p>Your second understanding is correct. </p>

<p>We are trying to prove that for all natural numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion is true.  So we assume that we have two arbitrary natural numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ which make the hypothesis true.  Then our goal is to show that the conclusion is also true for these values.  </p>

<p>If you choose $$a=2$$, then if the hypothesis is true we would have that $$6 \mid (4b-1)$$ and $$2 \mid (12b+7)$$.  It turns out that this would actually be impossible for any $$b$$ we choose because $$4b-1$$ is odd (And also $$12b+7)$$ and 6 is even.  We can&#39;t have an even integer dividing an odd integer. </p>"

How do we know when to use more than 2 base cases for POSI?: I remember there were questions on the mobius quiz that required more than 2 base cases for POSI. Could we get POSI questions with more than 2 base cases and how would we know when to use more than 2 base cases?,"I think it depends on how many terms the recursive sequence goes back is the number of base cases you need.

It should be $$\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, (k &gt; 2) \land (k \mid n^3-n)$$.

<p>Thank you! </p>","I guess the the statement that the empty set is a subset of S can be written as if x is in the empty set, then x is in S. But the hypothesis will never be true as the empty set has no elements, so cannot contain x. Therefore the implication and statement is always true.

From the first part of the equation, (yes you are correct) another way to think about it is to see that the set S and the empty set are disjoint sets. (Recall definition to disjoint sets). 

The second has to do subsets. Careful!,  notation &#34; $$\subseteq$$ means subset  and  then notation &#34;$$ \subsetneq $$ or $$\subset$$&#34; - proper subset.   What the sentence means is that the empty set is a subset of every set. Which is always true. Of course, the empty set is a subset of itself as well.

For example, if I ask you to list the subsets of the set $$S =\lbrace 1, 2\rbrace$$. They are $$\emptyset , \lbrace1\rbrace,  \lbrace 2 \rbrace,  \lbrace1, 2\rbrace$$.

Can you think of why the sentence is not $$\emptyset  \subsetneq S$$  for all set S?"

Is 0 a divisor of 0?: Does anyone know if 0 is a divisor of 0? Thanks. ,"0 | 0 is true.
<p>You can check whether $$m\mid 0$$ or $$0\mid n$$ is true for integers $$m$$ and $$n$$ from the definition of divisibility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the first case, we require $$0=km$$ for some $$k\in\mathbb{Z}$$. Well, $$k=0$$ works, regardless of what $$m$$ is.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the second case, we require $$n=\ell\cdot 0$$ for some $$\ell\in\mathbb{Z}$$. But this equation simplifies to $$n=0$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So $$m\mid 0$$ for all $$m\in\mathbb{Z}$$, but $$0\nmid n$$ unless $$n=0$$.</p>
$$0 = k \cdot 0$$ is true for any integer $$k$$. So, $$0 \mid 0$$ by definition."

<p></p>
<p>For the first one you have to prove the first two are a subset of V and vice versa to show its equal. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Show s is a subset of V (9(2c&#43;1))</p>
<p>- s: 9k=q for some element q in s</p>
<p>therefore plugging q in for c we have 9(2(9k) &#43;1). Since this is in the form of 9 times an interger, therefore S is a subset </p>
<p></p>
<p>- t: 3w = x and 6l does not = x for some element x in t </p>
<p>therefore plugging x into t we have 9(2(3w) &#43;1) = 54w&#43;9 = 3 (18w&#43;3) however from 54w&#43;9 we can never factor out 6, therefore t is a subset of V </p>
<p></p>
<p>Now to show the other way</p>
<p>let r be element in V, we have r = 9(2c&#43;1), which is the same as 9k=x therefore v is a subset of s. </p>
<p>r = 9(2c&#43;1) = 18c &#43; 9 we can factor out a 3 to get 3(6c &#43; 3) however will never be able to factor a 6 out. Therefore V is a subset of T</p>
<md>For the second implication, you need to justify why $$6 \nmid 9(2k + 1)$$. 

For the first implication, in order to show that $$a$$ is odd, consider what would happen if it were even and see if that leads to a contradiction.

So let&#39;s try to rearrange the equation so were set it 0. This way it looks like something you are familiar with.  That should give

Now, comparing with $$Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$$ (quadratic equation in the standard form), gives

 $$A=  1, \,B= -2 $$ and $$C= 2-a$$.
 Let&#39;s put this into your quadratic formula. 

$$x=\frac{ -B \pm \sqrt{B^2 -4AC}}{2A} =  \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4(2-a)} }{2} =  \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4a -4} }{2}  =  \frac{2 \pm 2 \sqrt{a-1} }{2}$$

GCD CT and Bezout Lemma: What is the difference between GCD CT and Bezout Lemma? I am confused when to use GCD CT and when to use Bezout Lemma.,"<p>GCD CT gives you a certificate that guarantees that your divisor is actually the greatest common divisor. So if you have some nonnegatie divisor d common to a and b satisfying conditions in GCD CT, you do not need to list all the other common divisors of a and b and look for the greatest. You know that the divisor d that you you have found is already the greatest. GCD CT is used when you have a common divisor of two integers and you want to conclude it is, in fact, their gcd.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bezout&#39;s lemma is a way to express greatest common divisor of a and b  as an integer combination of a and b. It is also a powerful result that will be determine when linear Diophantine equations of the type $$ax+by=c$$ have integral solutions $$x,y.$$ Bezout&#39;s lemma is used when you are given a gcd of two numbers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Combining Bezout&#39;s lemma and GCD CT you can show that nonnegative common divisor of d of a and b is the greatest common divisor of a and b if and only if ax&#43;by=d has integral solutions. Left to right direction is Bezout&#39;s lemma, right to left direction is GCD CT.</p>"

It even says that there are multiple s and t values, yet it doesn&#39;t mark these values correct. Why is this? Also, the picture is my second attempt and the same happened on my first attempt. Am I just missing something here or is there a problem with the Mobius grading?</p>

<p>Let $$a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$$. Assume $$9a^2 = b^4$$. Then, $$(3a)^2 = (b^2)^2$$. Taking the square root on both sides, we get $$|3a| = b^2$$, since $$b^2$$ is always non-negative for all $$b \in \mathbb{Z}$$. By absolute value properties, $$3|a| = b^2$$, which means $$3 \mid b^2$$ by the definition of divisibility. By Euclid&#39;s Lemma, since 3 is prime and $$b^2 = b \times b$$, $$3 | b$$ or $$3 | b$$, which means $$3 \mid b$$ as required. Since we know $$3 \mid b$$, $$b = 3k,\ k\in \mathbb{Z}$$. Since $$b^2 = 3|a|$$, we have $$9k^2 = 3|a|$$. Then,</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$|a| = 3k^2$$</p>
<p>$$|a| = 3(k^2)$$</p>
<p>$$3 \mid |a|$$ by the definition of divisibility. Since $$3 \mid |a|$$, then we know $$3 \mid a$$ also, as required.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>",This works but why not start with $$3 \mid 9a^2$$ and then get $$3 \mid b^4$$ and then use Euclid&#39;s Lemma?  You can totally avoid all the messiness of the absolute values.

"Fundamentally confused about Modular arithmetic: <p>Hello,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wanted to ask some questions about Modular arithmetic and congruence. I understand that at its core, we can say a=b (mod m) when m|a-b, but I have no clue what that means for math problems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When it comes to other operators/symbols, I feel like I can visualize what it means. When we say something is equal to another, or a subset of another, I can understand what that means and know how to apply it. Congruence, on the other hand, seems so abstract to me. The fact that something is congruent to another means nothing to me and I’m not sure how to apply it.<br /><br /></p>
<p>I see how we use congruence to break down huge numbers and I’m not sure how we are allowed to do that just because something is congruent. I would really appreciate it if someone could explain this to me and why we can do it. What makes modular arithmetic work the way it does?</p>

<p></p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>","<p>The way I like to think of it is that &#34;subset&#34; is a general term which could mean one of two things. Let&#39;s take two sets, set A and B.</p>
<p>Saying A $$\subseteq$$ B could mean:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. A=B</p>
<p>This means A and B contain exactly the same terms. For example, A={1, 2, 3} and B={1, 2, 3}.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. A is a proper subset of B</p>
<p>This means every term in A is also in B, but B must have at least one term that&#39;s not in A. So for example take A={1, 2, 3} and B={1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Every element in A can be found in B, but there is at least 1 (in this case, 2) terms in B not in A.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In both scenarios, A is a subset of B, but we can get more specific by classifying them as equal or as a proper subset. It could be the case that every element in B is in A, or that B has some elements that are not in A, but we won&#39;t know until we define their relationship with the more specific language.</p>
<p>You are correct that &#34;$$A\subseteq B$$&#34; is a one-way implication. But this doesn&#39;t exclude the possibility that the converse implication is true - it just isn&#39;t necessary given the hypotheses.</p>
<p></p>

So if I understand that correctly, q5b states that a number in base 8, e.g. 16 (which would be 14 in base 10), is divisible by 7 (in base 10) iff the sum of digits in base 8, e.g. 1&#43;6, is divisible by 7 (in base 10).

<p>hi there, im trying to solve q11 on ep6 and im a little bit confused</p>
<p></p>
<p>i started off with rewriting c|a as ck=a for some integer k.</p>
<p></p>
<p>then i substituted a=ck into gcd(a,b)=1 to get gcd(ck,b)=1. </p>
<p></p>
<p>i want to eventually get to gcd(b,c)=1 but im not really sure what to do next. tried using BL also and ended up with:</p>
<p>as&#43;bt=1 for some integers s,t</p>
<p>(ck)s &#43; bt =1 but im not sure how that would help me finish off the proof. </p>
<p></p>
<p>any hints would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance!!</p>","You&#39;re almost done the proof. I would think about applying a theorem to (ck)s &#43; bt = 1 to show that gcd(b,c) = 1. Think about a particular coprimeness theorem...
$$(ck)s + bt = 1$$ can be re-written as $$c(ks) + bt = 1$$. You should apply a theorem now."

<p></p>
<p>Also, if there is a constant in the non-linear congruence, do we just create a new row will the same value all across?</p>
<p></p>

Do we create one row just for the &#34;x&#34; or power of &#34;x&#34;, and create a new row for the corresponding value of x when multiplying the coefficient with it?</p>","<p>If the modulus is very large we don&#39;t have an efficient method to solve the problem.  (we could use SMT to break down the modulus but that is beyond the scope of Test 2)</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the constant you could create a row with a constant value or you could just add it to your final row.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>I usually create row for each term in the polynomial so I would create one row for $$3x^2$$ for example.  I wouldn&#39;t create a separate row for $$x^2$$ and then one for $$3x^2$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Having more rows in your table is not wrong.  To be honest, you could just have one row in your table where you evaluate the polynomial for each of the congruence classes.  This can lead to more computational errors though and that&#39;s why the textbook breaks it up into steps. </p>"

<p>This is different than the provided solution but I just wanted to make sure I have done this correctly. My logic is that for x in the set A, if any multiple of 21 divides x, then every 15th multiple of 21 must also divide x and so I got 315 t that way. Using similar logic for set B, that if every multiple of 45 divides x then so does every 7th multiple of 45. And so I got 315p that way. Is this argument correct?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Suppose $$\gcd(a,b) =1$$ and $$ \gcd(13a,7b) \neq 1$$. Denote $$ \gcd(13a,7b)$$ by $$d$$. Since $$7 \nmid a $$ and $$ 13 \nmid b$$, $$a$$ and $$b$$ cannot be zero as everything divides zero. So $$ d > 1$$. By Bezout&#39;s Lemma, $$ax+by=1$$ for some integers $$x,y$$. Multiplying by 91 gives $$91ax+91by=91$$. Also, $$d \mid 13a$$ and $$d \mid 7b$$ by definition. By DIC, $$d \mid (13a)(7x)+(7b)(13y)$$ which is equivalent to $$d \mid 91$$. So $$d$$ can only be 7, 13, 91 as $$d$$ is greater than 1.

<p>Hi,</p>

<p></p>
<p>1 = ax&#43;by</p>
<p>d = 13a(s) &#43; 7b(y)</p>

<p>multiplying gives something like: d = a(n) &#43; b(m) except n and m contain x and y in them, so I&#39;m not sure if I can set the x and y in ax&#43;by to n and m. </p>","Maybe it would help to think about why the statement is intuitively true - $$\gcd(a,b) = 1$$ means $$a,b$$ don&#39;t have any factors in common, $$7 \not\mid a$$ means that a doesn&#39;t have any factors of 7, and $$13\not\mid b$$ means that $$b$$ does not have any prime factors of 13
I think I might try assuming that $$\gcd(13a, 7b)  =d\neq 1$$.  Since $$d$$ is a positive integer which is not equal to 1 then $$d$$ has a prime factorization.  And so there must be some prime $$p$$ which divides $$d$$.  Show that this will lead to a contradiction. "

All I&#39;ve done so far is that if N is composite, then the prime numbers in the PF are all less than N. so we we know that (N-1)!, will include all the factors that make up N, so that means N|(N-1)!. Can I get a hint on how to write this symbolically?</p>","<p>I might be wrong, but this statement isn&#39;t true. What if N = 4. N is composite, then we get that (4-1)! = 6 $$\equiv 0 \pmod {4}$$.

<p>I am not really sure what $$p$$ and $$k$$ are since they are not specified in the question. After just taking them to be some integers, I was wondering if this is valid:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$x \equiv y$$ mod $$p^k$$, so also $$x^3 \equiv y^3$$ mod $$p^k$$, so</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$p^k \mid x-y$$ and $$p^k \mid x^3-y^3 = (x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)$$</p>
<p>by DIC, $$p^k \mid (x^2+xy+y^2)$$ so for some integers $$x,y$$, $$x-y = p^kx$$, $$x^2+xy+y^2 = p^ky$$, so $$x^3-y^3 = p^{2k}xy = p^{k+1}(xyp^{k-1})$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$k \geq 0$$ or else the modulus $$p^k$$ is not an integer, so this shows that $$x^3-y^3$$ is some multiple of $$p^{k+1}$$ so $$x^3 \equiv y^3$$ mod $$p^{k+1}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I feel like this proof so far is really sketchy, and I don&#39;t know if any of it even makes sense, and I&#39;m not sure how to proceed to show $$x^3 \not\equiv y^3$$ mod $$p^{k+2}$$ or how to use that $$3 \nmid x$$ and $$3 \nmid y$$</p>","<p>i think $$p$$ is supposed to be prime</p>

"[Sample Test 2] [Q5] Using prime factorization and DFPF: <p>I have a couple questions about prime factorization and using DFPF that follow from my proof of this question. (summarized at the end)</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Is it valid to just cite UFT and state the prime factorization of a number without proof? (I just used factor trees as you see at the top-- old habits die hard)</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Can I cite DFPF in a sort-of backwards way? (If $$c$$ is a divisor of $$x$$, and the prime factorization of $$c$$ is $$P_1^{\alpha_1} \cdot P_2^{\alpha_2} \cdot P_k^{\alpha_k}$$, then the prime factorization of $$x$$ must contain $$P_1^{\alpha_1} \cdot P_2^{\alpha_2} \cdot P_k^{\alpha_k}$$ )? You can see how I used this in my ($$\subseteq$$) proof to conclude that 315 | $$x$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. For my ($$\supseteq$$) direction, DFPF, I&#39;m also not sure if I used DFPF correctly to conclude that 45 and 21 are positive divisors of $$x$$. Do I have to explicitly show the representation of these numbers as divisors of $$x$$ like DFPF says or is it assumed by context?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In summary: Not sure about my use of UFT and DFPF in this proof</p>

TD along with hypothesis is very handy here to eliminate one of them). So since gcd(d,p) is 1, you can now use CAD in d | pb to say d | b. So since d | a and d | b implies d | gcd(a,b) by CDD GCD.

<p>I don&#39;t understand how if p^2 &#43; pq is a perfect square, then p must appear an even number of times in it&#39;s prime factorization.</p>","Note that $$p^2+pq=p(p+q)$$, so $$p$$ is a prime divisor of $$p^2+pq$$. And every prime factor of a perfect square must appear with an even exponent (why?).
<p>Adding to the instructors&#39; answer, the reason every prime factor of a perfect square must appear with an even exponent is more evident when you look at prime factorization. Note that to use prime factorization you have to have $$a\geq2$$ so if you need $$a\leq1$$, you&#39;ll have to add a case or something. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Let $$a\in\mathbb{N} \ni a\geq2$$. By UFT, let $$a= P_1^{\alpha_1}\cdot P_2^{\alpha_2} \cdot ... \cdot P_k^{\alpha_k}$$ be the prime factorization of $$a$$, where $$P_i$$ is a unique prime number and $$\alpha_i \in \mathbb{N}$$. Thus, if we square $$a$$ we get $$a^2= (P_1^{\alpha_1}\cdot P_2^{\alpha_2} \cdot ... \cdot P_k^{\alpha_k})^2$$. Then redistribute the exponent using exponent laws: $$a^2= P_1^{2\alpha_1}\cdot P_2^{2\alpha_2} \cdot ... \cdot P_k^{2\alpha_k}$$. Since every exponent is an integer ($$\alpha_i$$) times 2, they are all even. So if $$p$$ | $$a^2$$, then $$p$$ must appear with an even exponent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can use a similar process if you have $$a^3$$ and so on. Hope that helps! </p>"

<p></p>
<p>2. We assumed that $$i\neq j$$ in the beginning of the proof of fact 2. And since $$i$$ and $$j$$ are both in the range $$1\leq i,j\leq p-1$$, they can be interpreted as remainders upon division by $$p$$ in the sense of the division algorithm. But CTR says that each remainder on division by $$p$$ define a distinct congruence class, so $$[i]=[j]$$ contradicts the fact that $$i\neq j$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. For each $$i$$, we factor $$[ia]=[i][a]$$. We do this for each factor in the product $$[a][2a]...[(p-1)a]$$. The first becomes $$[1][a]$$, the second is $$[2][a]$$, etc.</p>"

Finding Private Key: Hi. I was wondering how you would find the public key when only given a private key. (no p and q). Since I thought we need p and q for the mod to calculate d. Thanks.,"n is equal to p*q, where p and q are prime numbers, so n&#39;s only factors will be p and q, aside from 1 and itself
n is equal to p*q, where p and q are prime numbers, so n&#39;s only factors will be p and q.
<p>Are you asking how to find the private key or the public key?  The typical situation is that you pick a $$p$$,  a $$q$$ and $$e$$.  From this you can calculate $$d$$. </p>

"Multiplying equation by multiplicative inverse of one term: <p>Hello,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most of the examples we covered in class were of equations in the form $$[a][x] = [c]$$. If the multiplicative inverse of $$[a]$$ exists in $$\mathbb{Z}_m$$, then we could multiply both sides by the multiplicative inverse to get $$[x] = [a]^{-1}[c]$$. Can we extend this to equations with multiple terms, where some of them do not have multiplicative inverses in $$\mathbb{Z}_m$$?</p>

<p>To clarify, if I have some congruence class equation $$[c] + [d] = [e] + [f]$$ and I know $$[c]^{-1}$$ exists (but $$[d]^{-1}, [e]^{-1}, [f]^{-1}$$ do not exist), can I multiply both sides of the equation by $$[c]^{-1}$$ to get $$[1] + [c]^{-1}[d] = [c]^{-1}[e] + [c]^{-1}[f]$$ without introducing extraneous solutions?</p>

Thus, $$\frac{|z_{n+4}|}{|z_{n-2}|}=\frac{|z_{n+5}|}{|z_{n-1}|}$$ for all $$n\geq 2$$.</li><li>Multiplying $$6$$ consecutive copies of the relation $$|z_n| = \frac{2|z_{n-1}|}{|z_{n-2}|}$$ gives $$\prod_{j=n}^{n+5} |z_j| = 2^6 \frac{|z_{n+4}|}{|z_{n-2}|}$$.

<p>Proof:</p>
<p>Proof by contrapositive. Assume $$f(x) \mid g(x)$$ and $$g(x) \mid f(x)$$. Need to show $$f(x) = cg(x)$$ for some $$c \in \mathbb{R}$$. Since $$f(x) \mid g(x)$$, $$g(x) = af(x)$$ for some integer $$a$$ by the definition of divisibility. Similarly, $$f(x) = bg(x)$$ for some integer $$b$$ by the definition of divisibility. Since both equations must be true, we could have $$b = 1$$ (and $$a = 1$$). Thus, $$c = b = 1$$ so there exists a $$c \in \mathbb{R}$$ such that $$f(x) = cg(x)$$.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Using that fact it simplifies from  cos 3θ=cos 2θ, then uses the double angle identity, and Pythagorean identity.</p>

<p>As to why cos(2Pi/5) is a solution, well I believe its because you are using this fact: when θ=2Pi/5 then, cos 2θ = cos 3θ. So since the only way you were able to get the factors is from using this special fact when it comes to θ=2Pi/5, it has to be one of the solutions. </p>"

<p>or how 2=2(mod 3) is the same as 2= 2(mod 6).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Try finding any number that satisfies x=2(mod 3) and find their equivalents in mod 6. I gather you&#39;ll come to the same conclusion as the problem.</p>
<p>One way to think about this is if $$x \equiv 2 \pmod 3$$, then $$x =2+3k$$ for some $$k \in \mathbb{Z}$$.  If $$k$$ is even, then $$x=2+3(2j)=2+6j$$ and if $$k$$ is odd, then $$x=2+3(2j+1)= 5 +6j$$.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I am very confused by what strategies we are supposed to employ for these questions and how the solutions are found.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For Question 10, how do we approach the problem? I started by trying to convert to standard form, but it got extremely messy. It feels like the solutions presented are pulled out of nowhere, such as the knowledge that w happens to factor so cleanly. The other solution is similar in the sense that we suddenly try to find the conjugate of this massive number in the hope that it will work out.</p>
<p>How should we approach questions like these?</p>
<p></p>
<p>For Q13 I have similar confusion. I realized that we had to prove the contrapositive but didn&#39;t know there to go from there. Typically exponents in congruence means we should try using FLT or SMT, but both of those didn&#39;t apply here. The strategy the solution poses feels very arbitrary, almost like they pulled random numbers out of nowhere.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I guess the main question I am trying to ask is what the strategy is when we do problems like these? I&#39;ve done a ton of practice but I still feel like in these cases its less about being able to recognize and apply strategies and more about finding arbitrary &#34;magic&#34; values and using them to prove what we want.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would really appreciate any advice/guidance on these questions, but also how to solve things like this on future assessments like the final.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>","<p>For questions like 10, use the fact that if $$w\in\mathbb R$$, then $$\overline w=w$$ and if $$w$$ is purely imaginary, then $$\overline w =-w$$. This is usually the best way to show something is real or imaginary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This really follows from the definition of the real and imaginary part of a complex number, so there isn&#39;t anything sophisticated going on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You would eventually find the right answer if you wrote it in standard form, but like you said it is a bit messy, though not incorrect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For Q13, what did you try? I kinda agree that the solution presented is not very intuitive (to me at least) and I used a different technique which seemed more direct to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is part of why it isnt always helpful to post solutions to practice problems. We don&#39;t want you to see the solution, think that this is the only correct way to do a problem, and abandon the line of reasoning that makes sense to you </p>"

<p>The student answer is not entirely true. There are times when POMI is sufficient to prove things for $$n\geq b$$, for values of $$b$$ which are not 1.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also there are times when it is appropriate to use POSI when you are proving things for $$n\geq 1$$</p>

<p>Use POMI when you need to only assume $$P(k)$$ to prove $$P(k+1)$$. Use POSI when you need to assume $$P$$ is true for other values eg $$P(k-2)$$</p>"

"Mock final Q13 proof validity: <md>Hi, is this a permissible proof for Q13? The question is ""13. Prove that for all a ∈ Z, if $$a^8$$ $$\not≡$$ 1 (mod 64), then a $$\not≡$$ 1 (mod 8).""

Assume that a $$\equiv$$ 1 mod 8. Then, by CP, $$a^8\equiv$$ 1 mod 8.

Also note that $$a^8\not\equiv 1 $$ mod 64, so $$a^8\neq 1 + 64l \neq 1+8(8l)$$. This leads us to a conclusion that $$a^8\not\equiv1$$ mod 8.

This is a contradiction. Hence...

<p>from this, we know a^8 = 1 &#43; 8m for some integer m. pick m= 8n. Which gives us a^8 = 1 &#43; 64n which implies a^8 ≡ 1 (mod 64).</p>
