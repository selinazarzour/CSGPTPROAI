Question,Answer
"iClicker subscription length?: <p>As pointed out on the <a href=""https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs135/assess/class_par/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">CS 135 website</a>, the W Store&#39;s two shortest iClicker subscriptions lengths are 6 months and 8 months. Since the software is being used this term, I was wondering if it would be used for CS 136 as well next term.</p>
<p>That way, I can know if it&#39;s better to purchase the 8-month version rather than to buy another 6-month subscription halfway through that term and waste 4 months of it.</p>","<md>I don't think it is but will reach out to CS136 folks who know for sure.

The person coordinating CS136 for the winter term says he likes clickers and would like to use them, but not sure if he can get it changed in time.  So ""Greater than 0% probability; less than 100%"".</md>

It&#39;s important to point out that the 8 month version is only $2.50 more than the 6-month version. So it is probably better to buy the 8-month version just in case one of your classes (not necessarily CS 136) needs it."

"Questions: <p>I had a few question from today&#39;s lecture. </p>
<p>1. In racket, I tried running both ( &#43; 3 6 ) and (&#43; 3 6). In the first one, there is a space after and before the bracket, whereas the second one doesn&#39;t have those spaces. Both gave me the same answer, but what is expected of us? I know that there should be spaces between everywhere except two parentheses that are side by side.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>2. In the note it said (&#43; (1 (&#43; 2 3))) would be invalid since the parentheses are being misused, so would (&#43; 1 (&#43; 2 3)) right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Could you explain what this section from the lecture mean with examples if possible? I&#39;m having trouble wrapping my head around it?</p>
<p>     - (f v1 ... vn) --&gt; v where f is a built-in function, v1 ... vn are values and v is the value of f(v1, ..., vn). </p>
<p>     - For built-in functions f with three parameters, the rule is (f v1 v2 v3) --&gt; v where v is the value of f(v1, v2, v3).</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. When we say &#39;substitution&#39; it essentially means we are converting the mathematical statement into Racket language, step by step by using the arrows right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. What are the two uses of ellipses?</p>","<p>Firstly, your subject &#34;Questions&#34; can be more meaningful for students will similar concerns (@9).</p>
<p></p>
<p>For question one, there is style guide on the course website, it should give you a guide on how you&#39;re expected to format your code</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. yes the correct usage would be (&#43; 1 (&#43; 2 3)) because what&#39;s expected after an open parentheses is a function instead of a number</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. This section is explaining the substitution rule for a built in function (such as &#43;). The rule is that if all the arguments to the function are values, then the simplification rule is the result of applying the function.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. No. When we refer to substitution, we are talking about the act of simplifying a more complicated Racket expression into a simpler one. For example, in the expression (&#43; (&#43; 2 3) 4), we can apply the substitution rules, and replace (&#43; 2 3) with 5, giving (&#43; 5 4).</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. I&#39;m a little unsure what you are referring to. One use is demonstrated in your third question, I&#39;m not sure what the second use is.</p>

<ol><li>Although Racket ignores additional whitespace before a function call (as demonstrated in your example), you will notice that the examples in the lectures and the style guide conventionally use the latter <kbd>(&#43; 3 6)</kbd>. Since after an open parenthesis, Racket expects a function call, it is best practice to place the function directly after (i.e., no whitespace between the function and the open parenthesis). You will see various applications of how you should treat whitespace - but pretty much all instances revolve around the readability of your code and design recipe. I would recommend taking a look at the style guide and note the various uses of whitespace (particularly, when they are good or bad).</li><li>The reason the parenthesis are misused in <kbd>(&#43; (1 (&#43; 2 3)))</kbd>, stems from a reason I outlined in the first point: after an open parenthesis, Racket expects a function call. Here, <kbd>1</kbd> is not a function but a number (which is the same error message Racket gives you when you try to run this example). Here, <kbd>(&#43; 1 (&#43; 2 3))</kbd> is syntactically correct.</li><li><kbd>(f v1 ... vn) -&gt; v</kbd>  relates to a general Racket function $$f$$ that takes in $$n$$ arguments (i.e., $$v_1$$, $$v_2$$, ..., $$v_n$$), and outputs a value, $$v$$. For instance, you look at the example given in A1Q2, the function $$mean(x_1,x_2)=\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}$$ is equivalent to <kbd>(define (mean x1 x2) (/ (&#43; x1 x2) 2))</kbd>. If we compare this to <kbd>(f v1 ... vn) -&gt; v</kbd>, we see that $$f$$ is the function <kbd>mean</kbd>, $$n=2$$ (since this function takes in two arguments), and $$v$$ is the output, the mean of $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$. If we look at your example in your second statement, you may notice that according to the Racket documentation, the <kbd>&#43;</kbd> function can take in an arbitrary number of arguments to sum. In other words, both <kbd>(&#43; 1 2)</kbd> and <kbd>(&#43; 1 2 3 4 5)</kbd> will both run and return a value, the sum. Since the number of arguments is arbitrary, we can write this as <kbd>(&#43; v1 ... vn) -&gt; v</kbd>, where $$v_1$$ to $$v_n$$ are numbers, and $$v$$ is the returning value, the sum. Consequently, with respect to your second point, when we are given <kbd>(f v1 v2 v3) -&gt; v</kbd>, we can see that the function $$f$$ is fixed to taking in 3 arguments - and when <kbd>(f v1 v2 v3)</kbd> is called, it will return a value, <kbd>v</kbd>.

If we compare this to <kbd>(f v1 ... vn) -&gt; v</kbd>, we see that $$f$$ is the function <kbd>mean</kbd>, $$n=2$$ (since this function takes in two arguments), and $$v$$ is the output, the mean of $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$. If we look at your example in your second statement, you may notice that according to the Racket documentation, the <kbd>&#43;</kbd> function can take in an arbitrary number of arguments to sum. In other words, both <kbd>(&#43; 1 2)</kbd> and <kbd>(&#43; 1 2 3 4 5)</kbd> will both run and return a value, the sum. Since the number of arguments is arbitrary, we can write this as <kbd>(&#43; v1 ... vn) -&gt; v</kbd>, where $$v_1$$ to $$v_n$$ are numbers, and $$v$$ is the returning value, the sum. Consequently, with respect to your second point, when we are given <kbd>(f v1 v2 v3) -&gt; v</kbd>, we can see that the function $$f$$ is fixed to taking in 3 arguments - and when <kbd>(f v1 v2 v3)</kbd> is called, it will return a value, <kbd>v</kbd>. It&#39;s ok if this is a little confusing for now... when you start covering the design recipe and contracts in Module 04, this might be much clearer to you!</li><li>Converting a mathematical statement into Racket language is typically considered implementing a function definition or function translation. Substitution relates closer to stepping, which is how Racket processes your code and produces a result. You will notice in steppers and in Module 02, when you call a function, the variables are being <em>substituted<strong> </strong></em>with simple expressions. Module 02 Slide 12 gives a good example of what substitution looks like!</li><li>As stated in Point 3, the ellipses in these cases are used to denote a possible, arbitrary number of arguments supplies to the function.</li></ol>

<p>2. yes the correct usage would be (&#43; 1 (&#43; 2 3)) because what&#39;s expected after an open parentheses is a function instead of a number</p>

<p></p>
<p>4. No. When we refer to substitution, we are talking about the act of simplifying a more complicated Racket expression into a simpler one. For example, in the expression (&#43; (&#43; 2 3) 4), we can apply the substitution rules, and replace (&#43; 2 3) with 5, giving (&#43; 5 4).</p>

<p>Thank you</p>","In Racket, a function has the syntax <kbd>(define (f x1 x2 ... xn) exp)</kbd>, where <kbd>x1, x2,..., xn </kbd>are parameters of the function <kbd>f</kbd>, and <kbd>exp </kbd>is a mathematical expression that depends on <kbd>x1, x2,..., xn</kbd>. On the other hand, a constant is simply a value binded to an identifier (aka a name). A constant has the syntax <kbd>(define id val) </kbd>where <kbd>id</kbd> is an identifier and <kbd>val</kbd> is either a simple value like <kbd>9 </kbd>or an expression that can be automatically evaluated to a simple value like <kbd>(* 3 3)</kbd>. So in your example <kbd>(define y (* 3 3))</kbd>, <kbd>y</kbd> would be a constant.

"Constants Q4: Hi, if I define some constants or functions in part a) and I want to use them again in part b), should I rewrite them again or can I directly use them? Thank you!","You can directly use any functions and constants <strong>defined in the same file</strong>, and it&#39;s encouraged to do so because using helper functions when writing your code can help reducing repetition and make it to be more clear.
You can directly use them "
"i keep getting 8/19 on the a01 assignment: <p>The 8 is from the stepper problems so im actually getting 0. When i run the code in the editor it works so idk whats happening.<br /><br /></p>

Basic Test Results

Basic tests perform trivial checks on your code to ensure that we can mark it
automatically.  It does NOT test your code.  That&#39;s your job.  The kinds of
checks it may include:
  * Are functions named correctly?
  * Do functions consume the correct number and types of arguments?
  * Do functions produce the correct type?
and so on.

What exactly are we getting marked on for A01?: Are we solely getting marked on whether our code works effectively? Or are neat syntax and readability of code also factors that can affect our grade? I&#39;m confused on what exactly our grade is based on.,"So for assignment 1, we mostly only check the correctness of your code, which is whether your code have the correct functionalities or not. Starting from assignment 2, we will have some hand marking components, and the style, which is the readability and neat syntax of your code will start affecting your grade.

Edit: although as specified in the instructions at the top of the assignment, you are expected to follow the style guide.

How many test cases for examples-a02.rkt?: Roughly how many examples would be considered enough in examples-a02.rkt? I just want to know what the marking scheme would be for that file.,"@197 <br /><br />
For example files (that you submit on Friday), 2-3 should be enough because examples just illustrate a sample use of the function. They are meant to show the reader what your function does, and are not meant to test your code.

For tests on the other hand, what matters is not the quantity of your tests, but rather whether your test cases can test your code throughly or not. As for marking scheme, we won&#39;t hand mark the examples but will run some test cases for it, mostly to test on the variety of your test cases :)

What is the proper format when expecting an error using check-expect?: If I wanted to show that the function would output an error using check-expect would (check-expect (symbol? b) error) work?,"<p>Generally, you would not need to write specific tests for errors in this course. This is because when writing your functions on assignment, you should follow the contract and/or requirements - which typically leads to a function implementation that does not generate errors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of the more common error messages are either the &#34;division by zero&#34; or &#34;cond: all question results were false&#34;, but these are usually handled by a requires statement or adding an <kbd>else</kbd> conditional statement that you may have forgotten. For instance, if a question asks you to write a function called <kbd>my-divide</kbd>, that takes in two numbers <kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd>, and produce <kbd>(/ a b)</kbd>, then you may note that an error will occur when <kbd>b</kbd> is 0. The assignment will usually tell how to handle this case with something such as a statement saying: &#34;you may assume that <kbd>b</kbd> is not 0&#34;, in which your function now becomes error-free (provided it is implemented correctly). You may also note that because the question states that <kbd>my-divide</kbd> takes in two numbers, you do not need to consider the cases if <kbd>a</kbd> was a String, for instance (according to the contract).</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you were simply curious about how to test for errors, there is a function called <kbd>check-error</kbd>. For instance, <kbd>(check-error (/ 2 0) &#34;/: division by zero&#34;)</kbd> would pass a test. In addition, <kbd>check-error</kbd> requires a specific error message for the test to pass (and something like <kbd>(check-error (/ 2 0) &#34;division by zero&#34;)</kbd> would not pass). For this reason (along with the aforementioned), it can become a little overwhelming for having to know the exact error messages and specifically where in your function you expect it to occur, which is why we do not use it often (or at all).</p>
<p></p>
<p>That said, you <strong>should not</strong> need to be worrying about having to write <kbd>check-error</kbd> tests at all in this course at least for the purpose of submitting assignments or on exams (Note: this is not the same as having you understand the different types of errors that can occur - which you may have seen being tested on steppers, for instance (i.e., the purpose of the Error button), and possibly on exams). <kbd>check-expect</kbd> and occasional <kbd>check-within</kbd> tests should be all that you need.</p>

For instance, if a question asks you to write a function called <kbd>my-divide</kbd>, that takes in two numbers <kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd>, and produce <kbd>(/ a b)</kbd>, then you may note that an error will occur when <kbd>b</kbd> is 0.

In addition, <kbd>check-error</kbd> requires a specific error message for the test to pass (and something like <kbd>(check-error (/ 2 0) &#34;division by zero&#34;)</kbd> would not pass). For this reason (along with the aforementioned), it can become a little overwhelming for having to know the exact error messages and specifically where in your function you expect it to occur, which is why we do not use it often (or at all).</p>
<p></p>
<p>That said, you <strong>should not</strong> need to be worrying about having to write <kbd>check-error</kbd> tests at all in this course at least for the purpose of submitting assignments or on exams (Note: this is not the same as having you understand the different types of errors that can occur - which you may have seen being tested on steppers, for instance (i.e., the purpose of the Error button), and possibly on exams). <kbd>check-expect</kbd> and occasional <kbd>check-within</kbd> tests should be all that you need.

<p>However, for this question, we want to test your ability to simplify the conditions so that you can find the median with least number of comparison. So if you have &lt;= that consume 3 arguments, although you only call the function once, it is technically <strong>doing comparison twice</strong>.  So you need to make sure that your function does the least times of <strong>comparison</strong> to get the result of the median value. And that is what we mean by you may not use inequality operators that consume more than 2 arguments for this question. Hope that can answer your question :)</p>"

<p>I&#39;m not sure how to properly format the contract for this function. I want to use &#39;listof&#39; because I know that the function takes a list containing integers and symbols. How do I include both these types in a single &#39;listof&#39; expression? And do I need to be concerned about what order the types appear in the list?</p>
<p></p>
<p>(I looked through the slides but couldn&#39;t find an example for a list with specific different types.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>","<p>Without directly giving you the answer for your contract, I&#39;ll answer the question of &#34;how can I represent that a parameter&#39;s data type can be one of $$X_1,X_2,...,X_n$$, where $$n\ge 2$$, and $$X_i$$ for $$1\le i\le n$$ is any Racket data type?&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here, you can use the <kbd>anyof</kbd> keyword. <kbd>(anyof X1 X2)</kbd> tells you that a data type can be either <kbd>X1</kbd> or <kbd>X2</kbd>. You can also include more data types by writing <kbd>(anyof X1 X2 X3 X4)</kbd>, for instance. Note that when $$n=1$$, writing <kbd>(anyof X1)</kbd> is equivalent to just writing <kbd>X1</kbd> (and we do not typically use <kbd>anyof</kbd> here).</p>
<p></p>
<p>On another note, your contract should also be as specific as possible. For instance, if you know that a parameter can either be 0, 1, or 2, and your function only works with these values, you may choose to write either:</p>
<ul><li><kbd>(anyof 0 1 2)</kbd></li><li><kbd>Nat</kbd>, with a requirements stating that the parameter is 0, 1, or 2</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, when this specific list of natural numbers becomes very large and you cannot easily generate the possible inputs in a simple requires statement, representing it as <kbd>Nat</kbd> is completely fine (and similar for other data types). We typically would do something like this when there are maybe a few possibilities for a parameter (mainly to prevent our contract from being obnoxiously long).</p>

<p></p>
<p>(Dillon) Although you technically can use helper functions in later questions (and Racket will not complain), from what I have seen on A03, the questions should be do-able based on what you have seen so far (i.e., you can complete a question without having to read/complete a later question in the assignment).

<p>Your unit load is likely set to take 5 courses (2.5 units) and you are typically allowed 0.25 over this so your unit load is 2.75.  However, if you have course selected four 0.5 unit courses and a 0.25 unit lab or music ensemble. then trying to add CS 136 and 136L (0.75 units) brings the total to 3.0 units which is over the limit. </p>

<p>This then causes a horrible error message about not having the appropriate &#34;requisite&#34; for CS 136 which makes no sense since you are in CS 135.  But since the system can&#39;t add both 136 and 136L it tries to add one of them but then gives you this error because the other is co-req.</p>

<p>In any case, that is one likely cause - try dropping one of your course selected courses, then add CS 136 and 136L.</p>

How to correctly define an element of a list being another list: If an element of a list is another list with only numbers would I say that the list is of Any or of Num?,"<md>The notation is `(listof X)` where `X` is the type of the list.  So we can have `(listof Num)` for a list of numbers, `(listof Str)` for a list of strings, `(listof Sphere)` for a list of Spheres (provided you have a data definition for `Sphere`.

do we write a helper function for list arguments: is a helper function/constant required according to the style guide for (for example) (first lst) (first(rest lst)) and such because this is often repeated in the code,"I don’t think so.
<md>Slide M02-41 gives several reasons for using a helper function:
* reduce repeated code by generalizing similar expressions
* factor out complex calculations
* give a meaningful name to something

Helper functions are a judgement call.  If any of the above apply, we encourage you to use a helper function.</md>"

See Patrick's followup discussion, below.  I personally would not say that one example is always enough nor that we would necessarily say that ""As of A0x you need more than one.""  As Patrick implies, it's a matter of judgement and we need you to develop that judgement.  That doesn't happen if there's a rule that says ""one is (always) enough"".</md>

"A04 Q3b: function needs to use cons?: Can someone clarify, for q3b on A04, the examples and tests can use list but the function&#39;s input and output must use cons for the list, right?","<md>Since list abbreviations have not been covered until the coverage point for this assignment, you should use cons notation in all lists you write.

A04Q3 gives explicit permission to use `list`, if you want, in spite of the fact that it comes after the last slide of the coverage.  Using `list` likely makes your job less tedious, but the assignment can be completed without it.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""the function's input and output"".  `sort-cards` *consumes* a list of cards.  It doesn't matter whether that list is created using `cons` or `list`.  `sort-cards` *produces* a list of cards.  You'll need to choose carefully between `cons` and `list` to do the right thing.</md>

A04 Q2a: Can we use the wrapper function (remove-from s c) and helper function (remove-from/char loc c) given in the style guide? or it count plagiarism if I use it?,"If you are copying code, it is plagiarism, if you know how it works, why not make your own version.

A04 Q3A: “Check for specific types&#34;: “Your functions must check for the specific types used in Dou Dizhu; ie you may not simply use equal?” <div><br /></div><div>What is this supposed to mean? I assumed that for card=? it produces true if the two values inputted are the same so why can’t we just use equal?</div><div><br /></div><div>ex: if ‘King and ‘King are inputted that returns true?</div>,"<md>`equal?` is a huge and powerful tool.  We haven't discussed it yet in class, but it does things like:

```
(equal? true false) => false
(equal? (+ 1 1) 2) => true
(equal? ""onetwo"" (string-append ""one"" ""too"")) => false
(equal? 'earth 'mars) => false
(equal? (cons 'one (cons 2 (cons ""three"" empty)))
            (list 'one 2 ""three"")) => true
```
In other words, it does A LOT of work to figure out if two things are equal or not.  It checks lots of possibilities and, in the case of lists, checks the whole thing.  

You could implement `(define (card=? c1 c2) (equal? c1 c2))` and call it a day.  But you would not have learned very much.  So please implement `card=?` without using `equal?`.  You can use other predicates.</md>
So you mean that we just can&#39;t use the function equal?. That&#39;s it? How about symbol=?, do you mean that we are not allowed to use any =? and try to separate the symbols/numbers and compare them one to one? I mean I input &#39;Black and &#39;Red, then I may use a recursion to compare B with R. Since they are not the same, I return false. Or I can use = for the integers and symbol=? for the symbols(&#39;Black &#39; Red)?"

"A05 Q3 (d) Do we have to consider straights and airplanes?: <p>This passage is confusing to me:</p>
<p>&#34;This sort order is more specific than actually required by the rule of Dou Dizhu.

<p></p>
<p>According to the 4 rules, the second list would come before the first if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p>
<p>Does this mean we have to consider straights and airplanes in our code for (d), or can we just use the rules defined?</p>","After reading the rules again, I think it means you don&#39;t have to consider the straights-after-airplanes rule and just sort them like normal. 
Terribly sorry! I misread the assignment number and answered incorrectly. It appears I cannot delete my answer.
Happily for us, question 3(d) doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the rules of what hand can be played. You are simply taking a natural number n and a sorted list of Cards, and producing a new list of cards that occured at least n times in the original list. 
<p>According to that passage that you quoted, it is giving an example how our sorting rules differ from the actual rules of Dou Dizhu. In other words, it is saying that in the actual game of Dou Dizhu, you cannot play <kbd>(list 4 5 6 7 8 9)</kbd> after <kbd>(list 3 3 3 4 4 4)</kbd>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, in the sorting rules specified in the assignment, since hands of equal length are sorted according to card values of the first card (where the smaller value appears first), this would mean that <kbd>(list 3 3 3 4 4 4)</kbd> should appear before <kbd>(list 4 5 6 7 8 9)</kbd>.</p>"

"Questions about module 6 and 7: <p>I had a few questions when reviewing the modules. </p>

<p>This is the function: (define wish-list (cons &#34;comics&#34; (cons &#34;turtle figure&#34; (cons &#34;donkey kong&#34; (cons &#34;play-doh set&#34; empty)))))</p>
<p>This is the check-expect (where I&#39;m using member?): (check-expect (member? &#34;comics&#34; wish-list) true)</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. I’m confused as the why the cond expression is broken up into the pieces in the example below. Using the general template we were given in the module, couldn&#39;t we just create a cond where it checks if the first element and acts on it accordingly and them checks the rest of the list? In the example below, why are we creating separate cones for when the first elements meets the requirements vs when it doesn&#39;t?</p>
<p>This is the template I’m referring to:</p>
<p>(<strong>define</strong> (listof-X-template lox)</p>
<p>(<strong>cond</strong> [(empty? lox) ...][(cons? lox) (... (first lox)</p>
<p>(listof-X-template (rest lox)))]))</p>

<p>[(char=? ch (first loc)) (remove-char/lst ch (rest loc))]</p>
<p>[<strong>else</strong> (cons (first loc)(remove-char/lst ch (rest loc)))]))</p>

<p>3. Is insert a built-in function?</p>","<p>1.  I think you have a misunderstanding bewteen a function vs a constant.  Built-in functions work the same way as user-defined functions.  The syntax for a function application is: <kbd>(function_name argument1 argument2 ... argumentk)</kbd>.</p>

"Requirements on the Arguments of Functions: Is the requires section under the contract only included when certain values of a data type that could be inputted into a function according the the contract would cause some kind of error in the function, or should it also be used when certain values that will never be inputted into a function cause an error? For example, if a helper function produces an error when any integer other than 2 or 4 is inputted but the main function will never use it with any other integers. Similarly, should the requires section be included for values that will never be inputted into a function that don&#39;t cause an error, but do cause a meaningless solution? Essentially, if the contract for a helper function says the input is for example Nat but the main function only ever uses that helper function with 2 or 4, should we consider the possibility that any other Nat is inputted into the helper function in the design recipe?","<p>The Requires section of your contract is to specify any further restrictions that the pre-existing Racket data types cannot reflect on their own. In addition, the purpose of writing a contract and/or a requires section is to inform the user what the function can accept. In CS135, if you asked to write a function <kbd>(foo x)</kbd> where <kbd>x</kbd> is a Nat, then this tells you that we are never going to test your function <kbd>foo</kbd> on any other consumed value other than a natural number. Note that in the real world, it is possible that users will still disobey the contract - and this is part of the motivation for programmers to implement error handling in their code. For the purposes of CS135, we will never test your function with arguments that disobey the stated contract and/or requires section (i.e., no error handling is required unless specified, which is unlikely for us to ask for).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, with respect to your example, there are some ways to make your contract more specific. If you know that an argument will always either be 2 or 4, then instead of writing <kbd>Nat</kbd> in the contract, @437 suggests that you can write <kbd>(anyof 2 4)</kbd>. Since <kbd>anyof</kbd> is formally introduced in Module 07 Slide 36, then until you start working on A05, you can write <kbd>Nat</kbd> in your contract and specify in your Requires sections that the argument can only be either 2 or 4.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With respect to helper functions, it is best practice to write the contract and/or requirements in the general case, not necessarily specific to functions that depend on it. For instance, suppose a question asked: &#34;Write a function <kbd>(foo x)</kbd> where <kbd>x</kbd> is a Nat between 0-10 inclusive. If <kbd>x</kbd> is even, return <kbd>x</kbd> squared, otherwise return <kbd>x</kbd> cubed.&#34; One possible solution to this problem looks like the following:</p>
<pre>
;; foo: Nat -&gt; Nat
;; Requires: 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 10
(define (foo x)
   (cond [(even? x) (foo/expt x 2)]
         [else (foo/expt x 3)]))

;; foo/expt: Num Num -&gt; Num
(define (foo/expt x n) (expt x n))</pre>
<p></p>
<p>As a result, you can see that <kbd>foo/expt</kbd> will only ever use <kbd>x</kbd> between natural numbers 0-10 inclusively, and <kbd>n</kbd> either 2 or 3. However, in the general case, <kbd>foo/expt</kbd> can be expanded to work according to the contract of <kbd>expt</kbd>, which uses <kbd>Num</kbd> instead of <kbd>Nat</kbd>. Writing the contract and/or requires in the general case is useful because, if you see a function later in the assignment that can also use this helper function, you do not need to worry about continuously modifying your contract.</p>

Q4 a): What should I write for function definition? Thank you.,"<md>We do not answer questions that ask for solutions.

------------
Try looking at the templates we've defined in class for inspiration.  

You want to look at the data definition.  For each part of the data definition:
* If it's a defined data type (eg `(listof X)`) apply that type's template.
* If it says ""One of"" include a `cond` to distinguish the parts
* If it's something that has several parts (eg a list has first and rest; a Sphere has x, y, z, and radius), extract each part.

Apply the above recursively.

"a04 helper function design recipe: <p>Am still a bit confused for the design recipe of helper functions.

So, what should I really be including in a helper function for a04?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you :)</p>","In assignment 5, you will find you need many helper functions to solve some of the questions. So for <strong>helper functions only on A05</strong>, you are allowed to skip writing the design recipe apart from tests (we still encourage you to write it, as it is a good practice). You must still write the design recipe for all functions on A04, and all your main functions in A05"

"a05 cons vs append: <p>Is using cons is more efficient than using append?</p>

<p>Since the example for append in the slideshow shows that it is recursive (and uses cons anyways) and some of the solutions can be written with both cons and append (e.g. in Q3).</p>","<md>Sometimes append is indeed a more efficient way of implementing cons, but you need to be mindful of the consumed type of both functions. For cons, it consumes a value, and a list value. While append consumes two list values and put merge them together. If you are not sure which one to use, try it out in the terminal :)

--------------
Byron adds:

I'm having trouble coming up with a scenario in which `append` is more efficient than `cons` unless you are applying `cons` many times (e.g. wrote your own version of `append`).

The purpose of `cons` is to make a list one element longer by adding a new element at the front.
The purpose of `append` is to combine two lists to make one, longer list.</md>

<p>Here&#39;s an example using the <kbd>distance-to-closer</kbd> function from Module 02 Slide 39. For reference, the implementation (without helper functions) looks like this:</p>
<pre>
;; Version 1
(define (distance-to-closer cx cy ax ay bx by)
   (min (sqrt (&#43; (sqr (- ax cx)) (sqr (- ay cy))))
        (sqrt (&#43; (sqr (- bx cx)) (sqr (- by cy))))))</pre>

(define (distance-to-closer cx cy ax ay bx by)
   (min (get-a-to-c-distance cx cy ax ay)

(define (get-b-to-c-distance cx cy bx by)

<p>Here, it is obvious that <kbd>get-a-to-c-distance</kbd> and <kbd>get-b-to-c-distance</kbd> are performing the same operation.

In Version 2, notice how these helper functions still do not solve this problem (i.e., if there was a bug in the operations in <kbd>get-a-to-c-distance</kbd>, it is likely that the same bug appears in <kbd>get-b-to-c-distance</kbd>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a result, it is best to combine these helper functions to give us the implementation as shown on Module 02 Slide 40:</p>

<p>Then do we still need to write examples for helper functions, or the tests already covered examples and we only need to write function header, function body, and tests for helper functions?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, can we use append for a05?</p>","<p>You should write test cases for helper functions. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a mix of examples (before the definition) or tests (after the definitions) but you should test each helper function separately.</p>

<p>This is just good practice. If you write a whole bunch of untested helper functions then you will have trouble figuring out what is wrong when things don&#39;t work. When I&#39;m doing the assignments myself (or creating them) my working file is packed with test cases so that I know that each helper function works the way I intended before I use it in another function.

Is there a name for the hand (3 4 5), as it was not identified in the question, and why is it valued higher than a trio? Following this logic would a (3 4) be valued higher than a (3 3)? <br /><br />Thank you in advance","In the sort question, all hands (except for bomb and rocket) are ranked according to their length, and if they have the same length, we will check their individual cards from left to right.

<p>Yes you do repeat the entire process for them, and you should structure them in dependence order, so that the helper function is always defined first before being called. Other than that, you do exactly the same thing for helper functions as you do for functions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Edit: I would disagree that the helper function is <em>always</em> defined first before being called. In many assignments that you write, your main function usually appears first (with the helper functions usually coming after). There are some cases where you write the helper functions first, however (Section 4.6 of the style guide is a great reference).</p>
<p></p>
<p>As for design recipe for helpers, Section 4.6 of the style guide states that only tests are optional (and the rest of the design recipe components are required). Of course, if we stated exceptions to this (such as on A05), you would follow these new rules. You can also just write the design recipe directly around your functions (so it does not crossover to another function&#39;s design recipe). You can refer to the sample solutions or Section 11 of the style guide to see this clearer.</p>

<p>What data definition do is to help you to simplify your contract, and make it better for the reader to understand your contract. Basically whenever you use a  specific type of data for many times, you can define it to be a data structure. We often define data definition for lists that have a complicated structure but follow the same pattern, or all have the same structure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m not very sure which two functions are you referencing to. But based on the two lines of code you show me, clearly the return type is a list. Remember for the &#39;cons&#39; function, the syntax is as follows: </p>
<p></p>
<p>(cons val list) where val can be any values and list is a list value. So in the first example, n is the value and the function call return a list. And for the second example, the first function return a value and the second function return a list.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4</p>
<p></p>
<p>Association list is a very specific type of nested list. The definition of nested list is very general, basically whenever you have list inside of a list, you have a nested list. However, for association list, you have to have a list of (key, value) pairs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Edit: If you want a comparison between the two in terms of data definitions, an association list (from Module 07 Slide 31) and nested list can be defined as follows:</p>
<pre>
;; An association list (AL) is one of:
;; * empty
;; * (cons (list Nat Str) AL)
;; Requires: each key (Nat) is unique

;; A (nested-listof X) is one of:
;; * empty
;; * (cons X (nested-listof X))
;; * (cons (nested-listof X) (nested-listof X))</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Note, I just made up a name for the nested list of X data type for example purposes. Something like this has not been covered in lectures yet - and thus you would stick to using something like <kbd>(listof (listof X))</kbd> or a requires statement for now, for instance. Regardless, as mentioned before, you can see according to this example data definition how an <kbd>AL</kbd> is a special type of nested list.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. anyof means anything among the types you listed, so in your example, the valid types are string and false :)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Edit: With respect to your confusion, no, <kbd>(listof (anyof Str false))</kbd> does not mean you have a three-element list with these data types in this order (you are thinking of <kbd>(list Any Str false)</kbd>). As aforementioned, this simply means that you have a list of arbitrary length, but each value in the list is either a <kbd>Str</kbd> or <kbd>false</kbd>.</p>

<p>Is there a difference between these two functions, or are they interchangeable?</p>","A list is either empty, or a cons. Calling list? on empty will give true, but calling cons? on empty will give false.
<p>Yes, there is a difference between the two functions.<br />In Racket, when we use the predicate cons?, it checks if the argument passed is the combination of two values (see the <a href=""https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Flist..rkt%29._empty%29%29"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Racket Documentation</a> for cons?).<br />For example, (cons?

<p>list? on the other hand checks if the argument is a list, which is either empty or some value followed by a list.<br />For example, (list? (list 4)) returns true while (list? &#39;Stuff) returns false.</p>
<p><br />To see where these two functions differ, just use the example when the argument is empty</p>

<p>3−2&#43;4/5 becomes (&#43; (- 3 2) (/ 4 5)).</p>
<p>But the arithmetic function does not have brackets to indicate the subtraction is happening first but that is what it is what the racket version is showing us? I would&#39;ve thought of 3−2&#43;4/5  being re-written as: (-3 (&#43; -2 (/ 4 5))</p>
<p>2. Does it matter where we put the yield symbol when doing substituion? I&#39;ve noticed in some modules its on the left and sometimes its on the right</p>","<p><strong>(1)</strong>: When converting a mathematical expression into a Racket expression, it&#39;s best practice to try to give a direct translation of the original problem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given the mathematical expression $$3-2+4/5$$, we know by the order of operations, we do the division first (i.e., $$4/5$$), then we evaluate from left to right. Treating $$4/5$$ as a built-in fraction, we would solve this problem by doing:</p>
<p>$$3-2+4/5\Longrightarrow 1+4/5\Longrightarrow 1\frac{4}{5}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>To give a direct function translation, we want to capture something similar. Since the first expression we want to simplify is $$3-2$$, we want this to be the first, inner-most expression. Thus, we have <kbd>(- 3 2)</kbd> so far. Then, it is clear that we are summing this result with $$4/5$$, giving us <kbd>(&#43; (- 3 2) 4/5)</kbd>, or <kbd>(&#43; (- 3 2) (/ 4 5))</kbd>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notice that although we perform <kbd>(/ 4 5)</kbd> first in math, we don&#39;t write something like <kbd>(&#43; (/ 4 5) (- 3 2))</kbd> since it starts to look different that the original probably in terms of ordering. This also explains why your translation, <kbd>(-3 (&#43; -2 (/ 4 5))</kbd> is not a direct translation due to the ordering as well as the numbers $$-3$$ and $$-2$$ which do not appear in the original problem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As another example, if I were to expand the problem into something like $$3-2+4/5+2-3$$, then in Racket, a direct translation would look like:</p>
<p><kbd>(- (&#43; (&#43; (- 3 2) 4/5) 2) 3)</kbd></p>
<p></p>
<p>Notice how the order is still maintained. In addition, if you are performing similar back-to-back operations, you may also be curious about the simplification <kbd>(- (&#43; (- 3 2) 4/5 2) 3)</kbd>. Although this is a good translation, it is not direct since we have simplified the direct translation by completely removing one of the <kbd>&#43;</kbd> functions (leaving us with one less <kbd>&#43;</kbd> than in the mathematical expression).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong>: Wherever you place the yielding sign is not too important, once you are consistent. Either of the following is appropriate:</p>
<pre>
;; Option 1
(/ (&#43; 5 7) 2) =&gt;
(/ 12 2) =&gt;

;; Option 2

module 07 simplifying list=?: how would you simplify the list=? code in module 7 (removing cond and everything),"If your function produces a Boolean, then sometimes it&#39;s easier to write the body using a logical statement (with logical &#34;and&#34;, &#34;or&#34;, and &#34;not&#34;) instead of using cond. 
<p>If you analyze cond with deep insight, you can figure out that what &#34;cond&#34; does is logically equivalent to what &#34;or&#34; does.</p>
<p>This is because cond has question-answer pairs in each square bracket and whenever a dr.Racket finds a question that produces true, the whole cond turns into the answer for that specific question which produced true. This behavior is logically the same as what (or ...) does. </p>"

"Does (= (length lst) 0) always produce the same result as (empty? lst)?: <p>from M05 </p>

"Non-Empty List: I&#39;m confused with the difference between the non-empty recursion list with other simple recursion.

<p></p>
<p>Are you perhaps meaning the the non-empty list type in a contract?  In this case, the recursive case is the same as above, however, the base case would be when the list only contains 1 item.</p>"

"string-append and append: In Fall 2018 Midterm 2 Question 5, it says that using append will lead to a deduction of two marks. However, am I allowed to use string-append? Because in the question it doesn&#39;t state any type of append; it just states append. Thanks","I did not teach the course back then but I suspect they didn&#39;t want a simple answer to the problem. Functions like equal?, member? are outlawed on the upcoming midterm because we want to see if you understand how to get things to work using the fundamentals. I would say try to do the question without a direct use of any type of append."
"Can predicates use (cond): Hi, if we are asked to write a predicate, are we allowed to use (cond)? Or is only (and), (or), etc allowed. Thanks!",You can do whatever you want unless the question has a restriction or stipulation.
"Written Indentation: <p>Is indentation marked as part of the written code? In the case where I have to add only one word or just a small component before a line, while all other lines are neatly indented, will I get marks off?</p>
<p>(I tried to write codes by hand and found it hard to precisely erase a line without distroying other lines)</p>",You should take your time writing your code since you can&#39;t just use a backspace button. Don&#39;t just start writing when you are solving a coding question. Think about your approach and how it would work. I expect you to possibly need to do a lot of erasing for some questions if you don&#39;t take extra time to think about your solution before writing.

Where did I get wrong?","The function in Q5(f) is a nested cond.  It is true that the &#34;main&#34; cond can never produce this error because of what you stated about c.

But you can make up whatever symbols you want for your program:  `'earth`, `'mars`, `'right`, `'left`, `'forward`, etc.

These presents must appear in the produced list in non-decreasing order based on their score.&#34;</p>
<p></p>
<p>1) Does this mean if there is just one present in the childrenList that the child qualifies for the child will get every present in the list? Or does it mean if the child qualifies for every present in the list they will get it?</p>

<p>2) Are we only checking the wishlist associated with that specific child or are we also checking every present in the other wishlists in the childrenList?</p>","<div>

<p>To determine the expect output for this, we: </p>

<p>2. Check the WishList associated with that child in the consumed ChildrenList (instr-childrenlist in this case).

<p>3. Look at the scores of the various presents and compare to the child&#39;s score. &#34;Hot Wheels&#34; and &#34;Colourful Pencils&#34; are both less than or equal to Byron&#39;s niceness score of 20 so he gets those gifts. However, &#34;Commodore 64&#34; requires a score of 52 which is less than Byron&#39;s nicest score so he doesn&#39;t get that present.</p>
<p>4. In addition, since the child Byron has a non-negative total niceness score, he receives get a &#34;Playing Card Deck&#34;. This will always appear at the beginning of the produced list of gifts.</p>
<p>5. It is also given that these presents must appear in the produced list in non-decreasing order based on their score. So all in all, the output of our function (the list of presents he gets) becomes (list &#34;Playing Card Deck&#34; &#34;Colourful Pencils&#34; &#34;Hot Wheels&#34;) in this case.</p>

<p>To determine the expect output for this, we: </p>
<p>1. check the child&#39;s niceness score. In this example, Byron&#39;s score is 20.</p>
<p>2. Check the WishList associated with that child in the consumed ChildrenList (instr-childrenlist in this case). You will find that the WishList associated with &#34;Byron&#34; in instr-childrenlist is (list (make-wish 52 &#34;Commodore 64&#34;) (make-wish 17 &#34;Hot Wheels&#34;) (make-wish 10 &#34;Colourful Pencils&#34;)). </p>
<p>3. Look at the scores of the various presents and compare to the child&#39;s score. &#34;Hot Wheels&#34; and &#34;Colourful Pencils&#34; are both less than or equal to Byron&#39;s niceness score of 20 so he gets those gifts. However, &#34;Commodore 64&#34; requires a score of 52 which is less than Byron&#39;s nicest score so he doesn&#39;t get that present.</p>
<p>4. In addition, since the child Byron has a non-negative total niceness score, he receives get a &#34;Playing Card Deck&#34;. This will always appear at the beginning of the produced list of gifts.</p>
<p>5. It is also given that these presents must appear in the produced list in non-decreasing order based on their score.

"3 questions about mod 8 - 10: <p></p>
<ul><li>For module 8 (Patterns of Recursion) Slide 7, I’m confused as to what it’s talking about with length? The entire slide just doesn’t make sense, could someone explain it to me?</li><li>For module 9, it says Sname may be used in contracts (and the s is capitalized), is this expected of us for our assignments as well?</li><li>For module 10, slide 7, it says ”number of children of internal nodes: exactly two, at most two, and any number.” I’m pretty sure I understand nodes, but the wording of this note is confusing me, to clarify, internal nodes, only can have two children or none right?</li></ul>","<p><strong>Module 8:</strong></p>
<p>Slide 7 is highlighting an example of exponential blow-up when the task involves searching through a list of arbitrary length. As an example, finding the maximum number in a list of numbers using <kbd>max-list-v2</kbd> (Slide 4), the exponential blow-up lies in the double recursive calls in the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose in a given list of length $$n$$, the maximum number was the very last number in the list (i.e., in the $$n$$th position). This is the worst-case scenario! Therefore, for the first $$n-1$$ elements, you will be recursing:</p>
<ul><li>Once in the second conditional&#39;s statement question.
<ul><li>This is the recursive call in <kbd>(&gt; (first lon) (max-list-v2 (rest lon))</kbd>.</li></ul>
</li><li>And again, in the &#34;else&#34; case, since the second case (i.e., the above case) fails.</li></ul>
<p>Let&#39;s suppose $$n$$ is arbitrarily large. Thus, for a list of length $$n$$, you will be first recursing on a list of length $$n-1$$ twice (since the first element is not the maximum, and you have the two recursive calls). Moreover, in each of these recursive calls (i.e., with lists of length $$n-1$$), since the second element is not the maximum, you will then have another two recursive calls on a list of length $$n-2$$. This process continues until you eventually reach the base case, the list containing exactly one element (which is the last element of the list, thus the largest).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a diagram, my explanation above is what Slide 6 highlights. If you were to then add up all these recursive calls (i.e., count the number of boxes in the Slide 6 diagram), you would notice this is the geometric series $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}ar^k=ar^0+ar^1+...+ar^{n-1}$$ where $$a=1$$ and $$r=2$$, giving us the value:</p>
<p>$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}2^k=\sum_{k=1}^{n}2^{k-1}=\frac{2^n-1}{2-1}=2^{n}-1$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>That gives us the expect total of $$2^{n-1}$$ recursive applications. The resulting exponential expression is what makes <kbd>max-list-v2</kbd> &#34;exponentially blow-up&#34; in the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the example of finding the length of a function using <kbd>length</kbd>, each element of the list needs to be encountered exactly once, resulting in $$n$$ recursive applications. Since $$2^{n-1}\ge n$$ for any natural number $$n$$ (equality only when $$n=1,2$$), this makes <kbd>length</kbd> more efficient than <kbd>max-list-v2</kbd> when the task involves searching a list, especially when $$n$$ is arbitrarily large.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With respect to worst-case complexity (or efficiency), <kbd>max-list-v2</kbd> is $$O(2^n)$$, and <kbd>length</kbd> is $$O(n)$$. However, as Slide 8 highlights, you do not need to know much about &#34;Big-O&#34; notation in CS135 - but you should understand the idea of exponential blow-up.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Module 9:</strong></p>
<p>Structure definitions have associated data definitions. Thus, in the data definition, the first letter is capitalized (since data types have their first letter capitalized by convention) - and by writing a data definition, you can thus use the data type in your contract. Other examples in Module 9 that reflect this are <kbd>Posn</kbd> and <kbd>Inventory</kbd>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Module 10:</strong></p>
<p>This is simply referring to characters of other trees. For example, each internal node in a binary tree has <strong>at most two children</strong>. Some trees have the characteristic that each internal node has exactly two children (such as a full binary tree). Or, in some general trees (discussed in detail in Module 12), each internal node can have any number of children.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any further questions! </p>

<p>Slide 7 is highlighting an example of exponential blow-up when the task involves searching through a list of arbitrary length. As an example, finding the maximum number in a list of numbers using <kbd>max-list-v2</kbd> (Slide 4), the exponential blow-up lies in the double recursive calls in the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose in a given list of length $$n$$, the maximum number was the very last number in the list (i.e., in the $$n$$th position). This is the worst-case scenario! Therefore, for the first $$n-1$$ elements, you will be recursing:</p>
<ul><li>Once in the second conditional&#39;s statement question.
<ul><li>This is the recursive call in <kbd>(&gt; (first lon) (max-list-v2 (rest lon))</kbd>.</li></ul>
</li><li>And again, in the &#34;else&#34; case, since the second case (i.e., the above case) fails.</li></ul>
<p>Let&#39;s suppose $$n$$ is arbitrarily large. Thus, for a list of length $$n$$, you will be first recursing on a list of length $$n-1$$ twice (since the first element is not the maximum, and you have the two recursive calls). Moreover, in each of these recursive calls (i.e., with lists of length $$n-1$$), since the second element is not the maximum, you will then have another two recursive calls on a list of length $$n-2$$. This process continues until you eventually reach the base case, the list containing exactly one element (which is the last element of the list, thus the largest).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a diagram, my explanation above is what Slide 6 highlights. If you were to then add up all these recursive calls (i.e., count the number of boxes in the Slide 6 diagram), you would notice this is the geometric series $$ar^0+ar^1+...+ar^{n-1}$$ where $$a=1$$ and $$r=2$$, giving us the value:</p>
<p>$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}2^k=\sum_{k=1}^{n}2^{k-1}=2^{n}-1$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>That gives us the expect total of $$2^{n-1}$$ recursive applications. The resulting exponential expression is what makes <kbd>max-list-v2</kbd> &#34;exponentially blow-up&#34; in the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the example of finding the length of a function using <kbd>length</kbd>, each element of the list needs to be encountered exactly once, resulting in $$n$$ recursive applications. Since $$2^{n-1}\ge n$$ for any natural number $$n$$ (equality only when $$n=1,2$$), this makes <kbd>length</kbd> more efficient than <kbd>max-list-v2</kbd> when the task involves searching a list, especially when $$n$$ is arbitrarily large.</p>

<p>In question 2a, it says</p>
<p>Write the structure definition for a SignMag that complies with the following data<br />definition:<br />A SignMag is a (make-signmag Sym Num)<br />requires: sign is one of &#39;positive, &#39;negative, &#39;zero<br />mag &gt; 0<br />if sign is &#39;zero, then mag = 1<br />The SignMag representation of a positive number p has sign as ’positive and mag as p.<br />The SignMag representation of a negative number n has sign as ’negative and mag as −n.<br />The SignMag representation of the number 0 has sign as ’zero and mag as 1. SignMag</p>
<p></p>
<p>Does it means that a structure SignMag must have two fields sign and mag where sign is Sym and mag is Num?</p>
<p>Also, it says &#34;mag as p&#34; and &#34;mag as -n&#34;. In other word, does this mean that mag only contain magnitude of a number to represent that number and sign keeps a number&#39;s sign with symbol?</p>

"A06 Q4(A) Use of Append: Hi, for Q4 A I understand that we cant use member and length since they go through the list more than once. Just to clarify we would not be allowed to use append here either right?","<md>Append function goes through list, getting to the last element and then puts second list at the last (cons ) of first list. 
There is a case when you can use append, but generaly, you shouldn't use this function for this problem. 

--- 

The special case is if you are appending to a _constant number_ of elements. i.e. if `lst` is parameter of your function  
`(append (list 1) lst)` is ok because first list has _one_ element  
`(append lst (list 1))` isn't because lst can have any number of elements</md>
Note that if you plan to use <kbd>append</kbd> in any of the applications as presented in the students&#39; answer, there&#39;s a good chance that you are just using <kbd>append</kbd> for the sake of it when you do not necessarily need it in your solution for Q4a.

"A07: Opnode with empty args: <md>What is opnode with empty args supposed to evaluate to?  

Based on M12 slide 9 it would be `0` if operation is `'+`, `1` if operation is `'*`.   

It makes sense if we assume that Opnode has args (i.e. base case), but it just seems strange that if we multiply _nothing_, we get 1. Shouldn't it be zero?  
Or should I just assume that `(length (opnode-args opnode)) > 0`?

<md>Sorry, answering this slipped through the cracks.

Be consistent with M12 slide 9: `(make-node '+ empty)` evaluates to 0 and `(make-node '* empty)` evaluates to 1.  It works with the base cases and if someone applies `eval` to an expression that includes these base cases, well, it's up to them.</md>"

Style guide question regarding accumulative recursion on Q4a): Should I write a seperate style guide for the function which uses an accumulator and the function which sets the starting accumulators or can I write one singular style guide for both functions?,"<p>Both functions will need a design recipe.

=================

The observation in the follow-up is correct.  The assignment does specify another, more advanced, simplification where a node that simplies to an opnode with just one number gets simplified to just the number.  That is,

```
(opnode '+ (list 2 3 4)) => (opnode '+ 9) => 9
```
In a more involved example:
```
(make-opnode '+ (list 'x 3 (make-opnode '* (list 2 3 4))))   ;; (+ x 3 (* 2 3 4))
=> (make-opnode '+ (list 'x 3 (make-opnode '* 24)))          ;; (+ x 3 (* 24))
=> (make-opnode '+ (list 'x 3 24))                           ;; (+ x 3 24)
=> (make-opnode '+ (list 'x 27))                             ;; (+ x 27)

There's also the promise that this won't be a large part of the correctness marks.</md>

Just a note to say that this example *could* exhibit ""expoenential blowup"" because it calls (function ...) twice.  If that function happens to be the same as the function you are defining...

One way to solve this without local is with a helper function.  Calculate the value of `(function ...)` and pass it as a parameter to the helper function.  The helper function can then use it as often as it wants without recalculating it.</md>

=======

THis is an excellent question that others may benefit from.  I'm going to make it public.

As a general rule of thumb, your code should be correct if you replaced each `...` with an identifier.  Example:
`(cond [ ... (first lst)  ...]` is not valid.  Replacing the `...`s with identifiers gives `(cond [ foo (first lst) bar ]`.  You can't have 3 things in a  cond's question/answer pair).  But `(cond [(... (first lst)) ...)` would be valid.</md>

""Can we use `equal?`?""  I think a better questions is ""Is it a good idea to use `equal?`?"".

Do you know the types of both operands?  In this assignment, probably.  So it would be better to use the predicate appropriate to them.

<p>Michelle adds: there&#39;s been a bit of confusion about this topic. Think about it this way: in the assignment, it mentions that if the arguments are all constants, they can be &#39;collected&#39; and evaluated to simplify since there are no unknowns/variables.

hint for A07 Q3d: Is there a hint as to how many helper functions we should have for Q3d?,"<md>Number of helper functions is a bad way to get hint for solution.  
  
There are many ways to implement the solution, I believe that you can do it with one helper function. However, with restrictions that are created in Q4 (Bonus question) I used 3 helper functions.  
  
Both solutions are valid for Q3d, they are just different.</md>
<md>Perhaps a better measure is number of lines to get an overall feel for what you're up against.  That, too, is a pretty poor measure because the length of lines can differ, etc.

But the sample solution uses about a dozen lines of code.  If you're writing dramatically more, you should reconsider your approach.</md>"

"Question on A7 2d: I understand that there are posts about examples on A7 2b. I&#39;m just wondering if the order of Symbols, OpNodes and Numbers that appear in the result should have strict order?

But my code produces:

Even though the basic tests doesn&#39;t show it, does this impact my correctness in any way when it comes to the final marking?

Thank you so much! : )","<md>Yes, order **matters**. Symbols have to be first, in the same order as they appear in the initial list. Numbers should be squashed into one, and come as the **last** element. You would lose correctness points if you don't do this.</md>"

It may have been a mistake to state the hint that way.  It may have been more useful just to say ""the sample solution has about 1.5 dozen lines of code and 3 helper functions.  If you're writing a lot more than that, you should question your approach.""

I suggest you start with some simple cases.  Can you simplify the first example given?  Write the code and when that's working, move on to the some more complex examples, increasing the complexity gradually.

By the way, your subject line could be much better than ""A07 Q2d"".  If you were looking in Piazza for an answer to your question, would you have clicked on that subject line to get the answer?  I've changed it for you, but you should do better in the future.</md>"

<p>(simplify (make-opnode &#39;&#43; (list (make-opnode &#39;&#43; (list 1 (make-opnode * empty) 3)) 3 7 10)))</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>below step is my understanding about the question:</p>
<p></p>
<p>-&gt; (simplify (make-opnode &#39;&#43; (list (make-opnode &#39;&#43; (list 1 (make-opnode * empty) 3)) 3 7 10)))</p>

<p>Is this what simplify is asking for?</p>
<p>Namely, in the recursive call of the simplify function, if we can simplify further, we keep simplify aexp further right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Always appreciate your reply!</p>","<p>The idea of simplify is to &#39;gather&#39; or collect constants that we &#34;know&#34; the answer to, leaving variables or unknowns alone - since we do not know what they should be yet. So basically, what is the most simplified form of the expression given the possible existence of variables that we don&#39;t know about yet?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reading the examples given in the assignment, specifically the last one provided, you can see that simplifying can occur more than once, until the expression cannot be simplified further due to the existence of variables.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the entire given expression has no unknowns/variables, then we know exactly what it should evaluate into. So we can simplify &#34;all the way&#34; into a single number, as that is its most simplified form.</p>"

Because the FileSystem data definitions are self-referential, you'll need mutual recursion like in eval/apply.  Because you've got paths, you'll need path-finding techniques.

One question to consider with respect to paths:  the path-finding we did in binary trees was `(cons name (find-path ...))`.  You might find another approach easier in this case.</md>"

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean here. If you mean the square brackets around all the defines inside the local, when you rename them and promote them to the top-level they become separate definitions and shouldn&#39;t all be in one bracket. If you mean the parentheses around <code>(define s (/ (&#43; 3 4 5) 2))</code> (or s_1) those are needed since not having them is a syntax error.</p>

<p>We use square brackets for convention. It&#39;s best you keep them that way in your steppers too so you can easily differentiate which ones are cond clauses/local definitions and which ones are expressions.</p>

<p>Our stepper rules slightly differ from Racket&#39;s stepper so we don&#39;t encourage it (although in many cases the steps will match up). It&#39;s definitely an academic integrity violation to use it for the required stepper questions on an assignment though.</p>"

  (cond [(list? val) (= (length val) 1)]

empty</pre>
<p>But if the nested-filter function checks the elements of a list before the containing list, the result would be:</p>
<pre>
(list (list 10))</pre>
<p>This is a simple example, and many more examples can be shown of what different results can be expected.

-------

We should have asked for the contract for `partition`.  Like `filter`, the type of the predicate is related to other types in the contract.  Recall that the contract for `filter` was `(X -> Bool) (listof X) -> (listof X)`.

For `partition`, the contract would be something like `____________ (listof X) -> (list (listof X) (listof X))`. What goes in the ""slot"" for the predicate?

In your example of ` (partition odd? (list ""w"" ""h"" ""a"" ""t"" 1 2 3 4 5))`, what is the type used for X?  Does odd? have the correct contract?</md>

Tips for Understanding the Stepping Logic for Local: Are there any straightforward tips for understanding the stepping rules for logic? Will we be tested in the final the same way we did the stepping problems? Some steps seem to not make sense to me and it&#39;s hard to memorize/understand. Any tips for that?,"<md>Basically whenever you see local definition, just pull the definition out in the global scope, change the variable name to be whatever_0, the second occurrence to be _1, and change the name for all occurrences of the variable in the local scope.  Then you should start simplify the definition you just pull out, and get rid of it when it&#39;s the simplest form (getting rid of it doesn&#39;t count as one step, you need to do another operation in the same step).<br /><br />This is basically the process of local stepping questions, and it&#39;s pretty important I would say. You should definitely know how it works in order to prepare for the final :)

---------------------
Byron says:  I don't completely agree with the above.  The order differs from the substitution rule and I think it is misleading to refer to simplification.  Given an example, with commentary:

```
(local [(define d 3)
       (define e (+ d 1))]
  (+ d e))
```
The next substitution step has three parts:
1. Give each definition a new, ""fresh"" (never used in the program) name.  `d` will get renamed `d_0` and `e` will be renamed `e_0`.  
2. Lift the definititions to the top level.
3. Replace `(local [ ] ... )` with just the contents of `...`.

So the next step of the above `local` is:
```
(define d_0 3)
(define e_0 (+ d_0 1))
(+ d_0 e_0)
```
Any simplification of e_0 comes in the next step.

Yes, you will likely be asked to do this kind of thing on the final.</md>

However, based on my log in MarkUs, at least for my last submission before the due for examples, the markus system was not able to catch the error.

I believe that it is unfair to deduct our marks just because the marking system changed merely before the due date without any notify or specifications in the assignment pdf, and I request to get a regrade for examples-a06.

Basic Test Results

Basic tests perform trivial checks on your code to ensure that we can mark it
automatically.  It does NOT test your code.  That's your job.  The kinds of
checks it may include:
  * Are functions named correctly?
  * Do functions consume the correct number and types of arguments?
  * Do functions produce the correct type?
and so on.

Lambda recursion: Is it possible to have a recursive call in a Lambda?,"<p>im guessing you&#39;re on question 3 and want to do what I did.

<p>(define (foo x)</p>

<p>         (cond [(... y)  (first x)]</p>

"Hidden Time Complexity Requirements?: <p style=""text-align:left"">In A06 Q4b post-mortem, it says: &#34;In both parts, many students did not use accumulative recursion. Although it was not a requirement, many approaches using append, sorting the result, or even reversing the result (even though it was banned) led to traversing the ChildrenList or ActionST multiple times. This can quickly lead to<br />exponential blowup - and hence code complexity marks were deducted.&#34;</p>
<p style=""text-align:left"">Is there a hidden requirement to always write less than exponential time complexity code unless otherwise stated (such as in part d of the same question)? How should we know that some questions cannot be solved with greater efficiency? Should we just avoid append and sort altogether?</p>","<p>The content coverage of A06 includes Module 08 where exponential blowup was discussed. When dealing with lists or trees (or really anything that you would need to search or traverse through), a common question programmer often ask is: how can I solve this question while only going through this list or this tree once?</p>
<p></p>
<p>You may notice that in A06 Q4b, for instance, the core of the question was searching through the <kbd>ChildrenList</kbd>, first searching for a name, and then depending on if the name was found, traversing through the <kbd>WishList</kbd> to get your desired result. There have been many examples in lectures and the modules that involve association list and dictionaries (and only going through these lists once to search for a value).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, for students who had to sort their answer after traversing the <kbd>WishList</kbd> most likely disregarded the ordering property of the <kbd>WishList</kbd> - which, if regarded, made it clear that it was quite simple to get your desired result using accumulative recursion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Although these restrictions were not explicitly stated in the assignment, using the tools and topics that you&#39;ve learn (i.e., accumulative recursion and exponential blowup), a relatively simple solution can be crafted to solve each of the questions in Q4. As a result, students who recognized this likely got full marks on code complexity, while students who did not got minor deductions.</p>

<p>This is also part of the reason why a good chunk of your assignments are hand-marked, where graders can look and assess the code complexity of your solution - which is something that directly auto-testing your code cannot always evaluate.</p>"

"Recursive functions with lambda: Hi, Is it always possible to have lambdas be a recursive function even when there are nested lambdas? How would we call the function to rerun on the rest of items?","<p>Functions written with <kbd>lambda</kbd> typically are unnamed, so I find it quite difficult to do what you&#39;re describing since you can&#39;t &#39;call&#39; on the unnamed lambda function.

<p>Now you can simply write the code for <kbd>(lambda (... f) (...))</kbd> and copy paste the entire lambda as the f parameter but this looks really bad and violates DRY. So you create another anonymous function <kbd>(lambda (... g) (g ... g))</kbd> where g is <kbd>(lambda (... f) (...))</kbd> and ... are the parameter to g.</p>
<p>So a very simple recursive statement:</p>

"Question Efficiency of Local: <p>First of all, I appreciate your feedback.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Summary of Questions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. For A10, we are encouraged to use local for the efficiency. However, logically, I know local is useful for storing a value that needs to be used more than once somewhere in the function and if computing value takes more time and memory, the role of local becomes more significant. However, other than that, if we are just storing a bunch of local helper functions or a value <strong>inside a function that calls itself (recursive function),</strong> wouldn&#39;t it negatively impact the performance of that function as <strong>every recursive application of that function </strong>must redefine and hold those functions and values locally? Whereas, if we define a helper function globally and use that helper function inside a recursive function, then every recursive application doesn&#39;t need to redefine helper functions locally so that overall recursive applications have less memory usage.</p>","<md>I've never run tests on it, but I've always assumed that DrRacket is pretty good at optimizing code.  It doesn't necessarily use the substitution model.  The substitution model is a MODEL -- a way to explain what it's doing, but it may have more efficient ways to do it.

I wrote the following as a test:

```
(define (foo_loc n)
  (local [(define (bar_loc n)
           (cond [(zero? n) ""bar done""]
                 [else (foo_loc (sub1 n))]))]

    (cond [(zero? n) ""foo done""]
          [else (bar_loc (sub1 n))])))


(define (bar_glo n)
           (cond [(zero? n) ""bar done""]
                 [else (foo_glo (sub1 n))]))

(define (foo_glo n)
  (cond [(zero? n) ""foo done""]
          [else (bar_glo (sub1 n))]))


(time (foo_loc 10000000))
(time (foo_glo 10000000))
```
On my computer, I got
```
cpu time: 1344 real time: 1468 gc time: 48
""foo done""
cpu time: 1088 real time: 1219 gc time: 39
""foo done""
```
So the one with a global helper function was marginally faster.

<ul><li>We encourage and want students to come to the help session if they are able to make it.

<p>Ok, what about at the start of the help session?</p>
<ul><li>We also want to control the pace of the help session. We prefer if, while the ISAs are explaining the question, students do not have their attention divided elsewhere in the starter file.</li><li>In addition, you can think of the starter file as your exam booklet (such as a practice exam) or a question bank. All the information to explain the question will be provided in the starter file - and there should be no need to copy the entire question down. Instead, focus on understanding the solutions to each of the problems and only write down the solutions (preferably by hand; not necessarily typing things up). Moreover, having a file to type things up as we go also refrains from the practice of writing your answer - which you will be doing during your final exam.</li></ul>

"fall 2018 Q2: For questions that we have to write a program that produces a function, do we include the main function and include the function we write in local? Because otherwise if we dont, in Racket there is an error as we may be calling an x value that must be inputted to that produced function, but that x is not actually defined.  ","At this point, if you are writing a function that produces a function, you probably want to use lambda instead of local.  However, I think you are doing something incorrectly - Racket does not have a problem (or will not produce an error) with what is asked here - the x is a parameter for the function produced."

<p>As you may have seen already, it is possible to write <kbd>list-ref</kbd> using HOFs.

<p></p>
<p>With respect to your second question, I think with the HOFs that you have seen so far, I don&#39;t think you can generalize that all functions can be written with these HOFs. A good example of this it the <kbd>euclid-gcd</kbd> function from Module 17. Since <kbd>euclid-gcd</kbd> use generative recursion on natural numbers, you can already rule out <kbd>map</kbd>, <kbd>filter</kbd>, <kbd>foldr</kbd>, and <kbd>foldl</kbd> (since these HOFs consume lists), and then rule out <kbd>build-list</kbd> since you are not building a list. As such, you can also see why <em>occasionally</em> we interchangeably refer to these 5 HOFs as abstract list functions (ALFs) since they all involve recursion revolving around lists. A small exception would most likely be <kbd>build-list</kbd> since we are not really recursing on a list in this HOF but instead using recursion to something similar to the <kbd>countup</kbd> function from Module 06 - which may explain why we kind of shifted to sticking with the term &#34;HOFs&#34; now so we can use a term appropriate for all of these functions (which is also what the comments of Module 16 Slide 11 may allude to).</p>
<p></p>
<p>With that said, in general, HOFs are functions that can consume a function as an argument. As a result, you can definitely write your own HOFs to achieve a specific tasks (such as the <kbd>card-foldr-n</kbd> function from A09).

<md>Oh, this hurts.  I'm sorry, but the student answer is NOT good code.

Parts that hurt:
* `(equal? lst (foldr ...` goes over the list twice.  Not a big deal if it's a short list.  A much bigger deal if it's a million elements.
* `(append (list x) rror)` is the same as `(cons x rror)`
* `(cond [(equal? ...) true] [else false])` is the same as `(equal? ...)`
* `(reverse (rest (reverse los)))` is getting the last element of the list.  Not a big deal if the list is really, really short.  Big deal if it's long.  
* the second student solution is carrying the entire list (except for the last element) in the accumulator; more complex than it needs to be.

My first question:  Does the problem say to use higher order functions?  I don't see that it does.  In that case, a solution with simple recursion:

```
(define (sorted-v1? los)
  (cond [(empty? los) true]
        [(empty? (rest los)) true]
        [(string<? (first los) (second los)) (sorted-v1? (rest los))]
        [else false]))
```
If it does say to use higher order functions:
```
(define (sorted-v2? los)
  (cond [(empty? los) true]
        [else  (string? (foldl (lambda (x rror)
                                 (cond [(false? rror) rror]
                                       [(string>? x rror) x]
                                       [else false]))
                               (first los) (rest los)))]))
```
In this solution, `rror` is either the most recently processed item from the list or `false` to indicate something was out of order earlier.  Because `rror` is something already processed, you want the next element to be larger, not smaller.  So use `string>?`.</md>"

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just wanted to ask a quick question about stepping with local since I see some ... between arrows.</p>

<p>Once the function (foo 2 3) is called, is there first a separate step where the parameters are distributed into the body of the function? Something like:</p>

<pre>
(&#43; (local [(define x 3)
           (define z (&#43; x 3))] 
     (&#43; x z))
   (local 
          [(define x (* 2 3))
           (define z (* x 3))]
      (&#43; x z))))</pre>
<p>Or do we straight to globally defining constants/automatically simplifying constants like in the slide?</p>
<p>Also, when lifting local constants out of the local block, does everything inside get automatically simplified as it exits? Would something like <kbd>(define x (* 2 3)) </kbd>immediately become <kbd>(define x_0 6)</kbd>, or is there an intermediate step where we have <kbd>(define x_0 (* 2 3))</kbd></p>

<p>No, the definitions do not get simplified first - renaming and lifting is first, and then they&#39;re treated like regular global constants/functions (i.e. you simplify the definition when you&#39;re on the line of code that defines it).</p>"

How to tell the difference of foldl and foldr if sometimes I don’t distinguish between left and righ: idk why I sometimes mix left with right or vice versa through all my life. and when im coding i have couple of times mistakenly used one of foldl or foldr since i mixed left and right. is there a way to better tell the difference of them?,"<p>You can label your right hand &#34;R&#34; and your left hand &#34;L&#34; (in fact, this is actually one of the most common tattoos that people get on their hand, since many people find it hard to distinguish which side is left and which is right). </p>
<p></p>
<p>You can also just remember that foldr starts combining from the end of the list and works back to the first element (same way simple recursion combines stuff), and foldl starts combining from the first element and moves forward to the last element (same way accumulative recursion combines stuff) - this will hopefully remove the left/right distinction for you. </p>

It's standard instructions that I don't think apply to the code you've shown below.  
```
(define a 3)
(define b (+ a 3))
```
`b` would already be defined to be 6 if it were included in the ""given"" code.  

If the problem started out: `(define a 3) (define b (+ a 3))`

Did Church actually prove that Hilbert&#39;s third question is a no?","<p>Anonymous at @3068 wrote:</p>
<blockquote>Did Church actually prove that Hilbert&#39;s third question is a no?</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Yes, he did. We were vague about exactly how since the proof itself is quite advanced, but it&#39;s not very different from the ideas in Godel&#39;s incompleteness theorem (and Turing&#39;s proof).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Godel answered &#34;no&#34; to the first 2 questions by creating a mapping between numbers and formulae (see slide 11). Church did a similar thing - he encoded lambda expressions using numbers and used some proof techniques beyond the scope of this course to prove that you cannot write an algorithm that consumes any two lambda expressions and determines if they are the same (i.e. the algorithm cannot give you a proof that these lambda expressions are the same, nor can it give you a counterexample for why they&#39;re not the same). Recall that Hilbert&#39;s third question asked if there&#39;s a procedure/algorithm that given <strong>any</strong> formula, it can either prove the formula or give you a counterexample disproving it. Church basically gave a counterexample - there is no procedure that can tell if two lambda expressions are the same. If the smaller problem (here the formula is &#34;are these two lambda expressions the same&#34;) has no procedure that can prove it or provide a counterexample, then the bigger problem doesn&#39;t either.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is similar to Turing&#39;s idea in the sense that Turing also found a counter-example (the halting problem). </p>
<p></p>
<p>Hilbert&#39;s third question is called the <i><i>Entscheidungsproblem</i></i> - you can find lots of discussion on both Church&#39;s and Turing&#39;s proofs by looking up this term.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re really interested in seeing how Church answered &#34;no&#34;, here&#39;s the paper he published: <a href=""https://ics.uci.edu/~lopes/teaching/inf212W12/readings/church.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://ics.uci.edu/~lopes/teaching/inf212W12/readings/church.pdf</a></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am currently working on this question and my plan is to filter the list for perfect squares and then foldr to multiply all terms together. The problem is that I&#39;m not sure how to write a predicate function which determines if something is a perfect square. I know exact?/inexact? is not on the module slides so I can&#39;t use it.</p>","You could try creating a lambda function I think that checks if the sqrt is an integer. That way if it’s not an integer (whole number) then you know it’s not a perfect square. 
n is only a perfect square if and only if (integer? (sqrt n)) produces true.

<p>When we get to node <kbd>F</kbd>, there are no out-neighbours so my understanding is that we backtrack to node <kbd>D</kbd>. Similarly, we checked all the out-neighbours of <kbd>D</kbd>, so we backtrack to <kbd>B</kbd> in search of another path. Since <kbd>B</kbd> has no other out-neighbours, find-route terminates with false.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is the correct approach, or if the path should just be <kbd>B D F</kbd>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I appreciate the help.</p>

<p></p>","Yes, this what conceptually happens but the implementation continues through the neighbours list without explicitly going back to the previous vertex.  I think accept your solution - particularly since the extra vertices are labelled as backtrack."

<p>I know that I need to use mutual recursion to do this question but I don&#39;t know how to recurse through the tree level by level. So can I get a hint for this question please?</p>","<p>If you want to approach this as traversing level by level, you would need to start at the root and count all of it&#39;s children.  For the next level, you then have a list of nodes and need to count all of their children - probably using an accumulator might be the easiest approach.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A less efficient method is to simply do a tree traversal and have a parameter that keeps track of which level you are on - then count all the nodes on a specified level.</p>"
