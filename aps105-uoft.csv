Please follow the posted videos to make it work (easier to follow for this lab and future labs instruction). if you have difficulties to install gcc and you have already installed vs2022, it should also be good enough for this course.

"Purpose of Debugger: <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had a question about the window that pops up when you run the debugger.

So now I am confused as to what the purpose of that window is. </p>","<p dir=""ltr"">I believe the window that pops up when debugging just shows the output of your compiled code.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">From what I understand, the debugger won’t necessarily tell you where the errors in your code are. When you have syntax errors (i.e., pritf(“Hello world”); instead of printf(“Hello world”);), you’ll get an error message in the terminal and can use that to fix the mistake.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">However, the debugger can be used to identify the logical errors (errors in the code that is syntactically correct, but produces incorrect results). This can be done by setting breakpoints, which allow you to stop program execution at a specified point. From there you can examine the state of your program (i.e., values of variables) and can even run your code step-by-step to pinpoint the source of the error. It&#39;s useful for understanding your code and what each line does.</p>"

"Addresses and &amp; usage: <p>Hello,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I just wanted some clarification on the use of &amp;. When using scanf, you are required to specify the format specifier as well as the variable so it looks like this for example:</p>
<p></p>
<p>scanf(&#34;%d&#34;, &amp;pizza) ;</p>
<p></p>
<p>from my understanding, &amp; accesses the variable&#39;s address so is the users input being stored in place of the address or the address&#39; corresponding value? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, once we initialize a variable, why do we not use the &amp; to define a value for it. For example why do we do </p>
<p></p>
<p>int pizza, slice;</p>
<p>pizza = 8;</p>
<p>slice = pizza*8 ;</p>
<p></p>
<p>and not:</p>
<p></p>
<p>int pizza, slice;</p>
<p>&amp;pizza = 8</p>
<p>&amp;slice = pizza*8</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hopefully my questions make sense! Thank you in advance</p>
<p></p>","<p>in the scanf function<em><strong> &#39;&amp;&#39; </strong></em>operator is used to fetch the address of the variable where values entered by the user or simply the user input, should be stored. when you use <em><strong>&#39;&amp;pizza&#39;</strong></em>, you are directly providing the address of thre <em><strong>&#39;pizza&#39;</strong></em> variable to <em><strong>&#39;scanf&#39;</strong></em>, so as a result the user input would be stored at the memory location of the variable <em><strong>&#39;pizza&#39;<br /><br /></strong></em></p>
<p>Answering your second question, when you initialize a variable, a value gets assigned to the variable directly. The code initializes the <strong><em>&#39;pizza&#39;</em></strong> variable with the value of 8,<em><strong> &#39;&amp;&#39;</strong></em> is not used in this context because you are not taking the address, instead you are assigning a value to a variable. If you use<em><strong> &#39;&amp;pizza&#39;</strong></em> then it would result in a compilation error because the left side of the assignmed should be a variable and not an address, so<em><strong> &#39;&amp;pizza&#39;</strong></em>, is an address thats why we do not use it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hopefully it helps..</p>
You will know a lot more when we talk about address in the future. That is a very big topic and could say the most important/useful/painful feature that C/C&#43;&#43; has but most other programming languages don&#39;t.

"Lab 1 Part 2: <p>When I was reading over the instructions, there is something weird about the outputs in this example.

<p>it seems that both of your files hello.c and lab0.c are being compiled into a single program, and I assume both of them have main functions. I&#39;m not terribly familiar with vs code but you might have put both files in the same folder by mistake?</p>
The student&#39;s answer is right. You need to put each of your C file under individual folder. Each file contains a main function. If you put two C file with main function under the same folder. The compiler will not know which file is the entry point and hence throw compilation error."

Try out return 1 (or any non-zero) number in VS Code. It will show that your code terminated with an exit code that is the same as the number you entered. Any non-zero number will result in a message saying your code exited with non-zero exit code. This signals something went wrong. If we reached a return 0.

My approach was to convert the arrival time to a decimal, do all necessary calculations, then convert the decimal to minutes; however, when I try to typecast or floor a double that gets outputted as what seems to be a whole number, it goes to the preceding number (e.g. 12.0 --&gt; 11). I believe this is because floats are not totally precise, which is probably the case in the issue I am having, and I know using the round function will violate the condition of rounding the minute to the <strong>lowest </strong>minute for some cases, so I am wondering what I can do to solve this issue. Any hints or suggestions will be greatly appreciated!","<p>If this issue is with all numbers, please post a private post with your code, and I will look into it. Or better, try using the debugger.

<p>I am afraid your issue is just with certain numbers. If this is the case, yes. `double` or `float` are not data types that store all numbers after the decimal place, so there is an issue with precision indeed. There are ways to avoid it, but it&#39;s too advanced for the course to discuss. This is one place that discusses this issue online: <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/why-floating-point-numbers-may-lose-precision?view=msvc-170"">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/why-floating-point-numbers-may-lose-precision?view=msvc-170</a></p>"

Assumptions for input:

1.  all input numbers will contain exactly one digit (looks like this has been addressed in @275)
2.  all input numbers will have a character `+` or `-` indicated before them, including `0` (i.e. to enter zero user will use either `+0` or `-0`)

Assumptions for behavior:

1.  input is not validated except for the rudimentary validation provided by `scanf`
2.  integer overflow should not be recovered, i.e. the following behavior is ok: 
```
+9+9+9....+9+9+9<enter>
...
Sum is updated to 2147483637

"Lab3Part1 &#43;9: <p>Hi, </p>
<p></p>
<p>I was wondering whether the first &lt;enter&gt; will be used in test cases? </p>
<p>When I typed in the test case manually including the first &lt;enter&gt;, it passed all tests as I accounted for this strange &lt;enter&gt; by catching it in an unused char. However, when I went to do the public test cases with ~aps105i/etc, I noticed it failed and would only pass if I removed the catching the first enter. So is this a mistake in my code, or is there no &lt;enter&gt; before the first number? </p>

<p>- When we assign a variable to another variable, it only copies its value.</p>
<p>- When we assign a variable to a pointer, we assign its location in memory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Therefore, when we update this pointer, we are directly changing whatever data is currently held in that location in the computer&#39;s memory.</p>
<p>In contrast, if we used a variable instead of a pointer, we are technically only updating the <em>copied value</em> that the computer has stored elsewhere, in an independent location.</p>
<p>Hopefully that makes sense.</p>
<p>The student&#39;s answer is half correct and half incorrect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The benefit of using a pointer is to mostly save memory space.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you pass a value to a function, the value needs to be first copied and then passed to a function. When you pass a pointer to a function, only the pointer(the address to the value you want to pass into the function) needs to be copied. If the value you want to pass into a function takes a large chunk of memory space, then the benefit of using a pointer starts to show.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The student&#39;s answer says &#34;if we used a variable instead of a pointer, we are technically only updating the <em>copied value</em> that the computer has stored elsewhere, in an independent location.&#34;, this is not accurate. When you update a value, you don&#39;t need to allocate a new chunk of memory. You still update the value in-place. The only time when you need a new memory space is to copy a value. I guess the student wants to say if you want to assign one variable to another new variable, then the statement is correct. However, keep in mind that pointer is just a type of variable, it also takes memory space.</p>"

Address of an VariableIs: Is the address of a variable randomly generated or does it follow any patterns?,"<p>The address is randomly generated. If you are saying if you declare a variable on stack/heap, will the address follows some pattern then the answer is yes for some cases.

<p></p>

int a = 0;
int b = 2;</pre>

<p>Assume the address of a is 0xFF70 8000. Since an integer has a size of 4 bytes and b is declared on stack, b should have an address of 0xFF70 7FFC.</p>

"Lab 5: eliminate original case: <p>Hi, for lab 5 should we prevent the user from attempting to eliminate the case they chose (ex. they picked case 1 originally, but then they use enter case 1 to eliminate )?</p>
<p></p>
<p>From my understanding of the game, the next cases the user picks are just to eliminate them, so technically they shouldn&#39;t be allowed to eliminate the case they chose, since the only time they can &#39;swap&#39; is with the last case.</p>","Yes, the user shouldn&#39;t be allowed to eliminate the case they have chosen in the beginning.
Yes, the case picked by the player will have -1 in cases array. So it&#39;s eliminated already in cases array. "

<p>I wholeheartedly agree with the student&#39;s response! </p>

<p>Sharing pseudo code does indeed solve part of the assignment and allows students to skip steps in the process of writing code. In fact, in previous years, many students shared pseudo code with one another resulting in 90%&#43; similar code. Cases like that constitutes as an academic integrity violation. </p>

<p>So essentially what we&#39;re doing is running the while loop until we get some sort of overflow error, and then praying that the printf statement still runs after the overflow error showing us how many bits are used? If this is correct, does C normally run the rest of the code after an error or does it stop at that line and spit out the error for you to fix?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for your time!</p>","<p>The purpose of the program is to determine the number of bits in an <kbd>int</kbd> variable (including the sign bit) without using the <kbd>sizeof</kbd> operator.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The solution works by creating an integer <kbd>k</kbd> with only one bit equal to 1, then moves it to the left (towards more significant digits) until the integer becomes negative. Since all negative integers have a bit set in the most significant position and there is only one bit set, we know that the bit has arrived at the end of the integer. We can therefore calculate the number of bits by counting the number of iterations required to do this.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is an overflow error, but even though we use the word error to describe it, this is not an invalid operation (it&#39;s not even considered abnormal on the CPU). Thus the CPU reports no error and the program does not stop (you are right that a CPU error will stop the program however).</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy from here, we use the formula discussed in class. rand() generates a number between 0 and 2^31 - 1. If we do % (999 - 666 &#43; 1), we get a number between 0 and (999 - 666). Adding to that 666, gives us a number between 666 and 999. Divide that by 10.0, and that gives you a number between 66.6 and 99.9. </p>

<p>exp()</p>
<p>trigonometric functions (and the fact that they work with radians and not degrees so you must convert)</p>
<p>pow() (also try not to use this for something like x^2, in which case you can just use x*x)</p>
<p>log()</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn&#39;t see floor() and ceil() in tests (yet), but my prof mentioned knowing these too, so those too.</p>

"Midterm 2023 Question 4: <p>Hi, for question 4 of midterm 2023, how does *p have the value of myArray[5] and not 0 in another [5]? Will it be possible to explain how *p works?</p>
<p>Also, having p = myArray does it mean that myArray will always start at 0 and p has the index value or it has another meaning?</p>

<p></p>
<p>Arrays and pointers are pretty similar in that the array identifier is a pointer to the first element of that array. In other words, when you create an array &#34;int arr[5];&#34;, &#34;arr&#34; is the same thing as &#34;&amp;arr[0]&#34;. Thats why you can intialize a pointer &#34;int *p;&#34; and set them equal. &#34;p = arr&#34;. This is the same as making p point to the first element of the array.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, &#34;p - arr&#34; takes the address held in p, subtracts it from the address held in arr (&amp;arr[0]), then divides by the size of the elements of the array (in the case of integers, it divides by 4 for the 4 bytes). It basically gives the distance between the addresses held in p and arr, so the division by 4 bytes is necessary to compensate for the fact that integers are represented with 4 bytes</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not sure how good I explained that so heres the textbook chapter for a better explanation haha <a href=""https://learningc.org/chapters/chapter07-arrays/what-are-arrays"">7.2. What are arrays, and how are they stored? — Snefru: Learning Programming with C (learningc.org)</a></p>

<md>`int* p` is a pointer to an integer

`myArray` is a pointer to the first element in the array, i.e. `myArray` is same as `&myArray[0]`

`p = myArray` means `p` has `&myArray[0]`

`p++` means `p = &myArray[0] + 1` which is `&myArray[1]`

In the loop, we add to p 1 every iteration, making it store the address of the next element in the array. 

If we dereference p using *p, then we are accessing the element in the array. For example, *p if p stored &myArray[1], then we are accessing myArray[1] which is 4.

Question about Star patterns in C: I am struggling with creating the star patterns in C. I noticed that we always how our for loop for rows first. Then nested in the rows for loop is what. I get lost on how to think through these patterns and how to solve them effectively. What are the steps to solve these patterns effectively.,"<p>Feel free to edit.</p>
<p>I understand where your struggle comes from so I&#39;ll just explain what my professor does since that breaks down your question about why there&#39;s a loop for the rows first then for the columns.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Follow these steps: </p>
<p>1. Draw out the stars and spaces in a table, literally a table.</p>
<p>2. Label the rows and columns of the table, let me show you in this example here: </p>
<table cellpadding=""6px"" border=""1px"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>*</td><td></td><td></td><td>*</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td></td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td></td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>*</td><td></td><td></td><td>*</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p></p>
<p>3. Identify the relationship between the rows and and columns - to do this, you need to basically see how the number for the row relates to the number for the column.</p>
<p>For example, the first row has a star in column 1 and 4</p>
<p>Second row in column 2 and 3</p>
<p>Third row in column 3 and 2</p>
<p>Fourth row in column 4 and 1 </p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Draw this out in another table to see how rows and columns relate, look at this example here:</p>
<table cellpadding=""6px"" border=""1px"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody><tr><td>Row</td><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p></p>
<p>Ah and now you see a patten :)</p>
<p></p>
<p>So you create a loop for the rows first because you see that the rows in the table increase from 1 - 4 going downward, so its logically easier, please <strong>don&#39;t memorize that, approach it with logic.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Okay so now we&#39;ve seen a pattern which is convenient, let&#39;s just make a loop that follows those patterns in our table, which is where our logic comes into play and we code it directly, with the approach you mentioned for having a loop for the rows first and now having a loop for the columns based on what you saw on the table above.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. So the approach is to print spaces and then print stars in the cases we identified in the table above :)</p>

<p>I hope that helped.</p>

<p>Running this prints 20 and 8, so I&#39;m guessing that the 20 comes from the size of the entire array (5 elements x 4 bytes per element), and the pointer to the first element of the array yields 8 as expected.

Yes, array is a pointer but not quite the same as a regular pointer. You can think of the array as an alias(or a label in a more formal terminology) to the address of the first element of the array. The array as a pointer (the address of itself) doesn&#39;t really stored anywhere in the memory space, unlike other regular pointers.

<p>When we take the modulo $$n$$ of a number $$x$$, we calculate its residue under $$n$$ (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this article</a> for details).

<p>The formula <kbd>rand() % (max-min&#43;1) &#43; min</kbd> is thus mapping the output of the <kbd>rand()</kbd> function to a set of values such that there are the same number of values as there are numbers between <kbd>max</kbd> and <kbd>min</kbd> inclusive, and then shifting everything up by <kbd>min</kbd> (recall that the smallest value is $$0$$) so that it has the image we want.</p>"

<p>You can combine all three of the above conditions into an inclusive range like so: print star if ( col &gt;= lines - (row-1) &amp;&amp; col &lt;= lines &#43; (row-1) ). This way you also don&#39;t have to include the condition col == lines because it&#39;s already in range.</p>

Question on pointers: I&#39;m still confused why pointers are necessary to allow a variable to be altered in a different function and also allow it to retain its value in the main function. What is going on in memory to allow a variable changed in another function to retain that change in the main function?,"Like the name, pointers literally “point” to memory addresses (the value a pointer stores is a memory address). When you pass a pointer/address into a function, you are telling the program where that variable lives in memory. That’s why you can alter it, since you are altering it at its source. When you pass by value (no pointer), the compiler creates a copy of that variable storing the same value in a different memory location. That is why you cannot edit variables in functions that have only been passed by value, you are not actually editing the variable from the caller function.

<p>Assume you have a variable X stored in memory address MEM1. When you pass X to a function, a new copy of X is created in MEM2 and this is what&#39;s passed to the function. Any changes made to X within the function are applied to MEM2, not MEM1. That&#39;s why when you return from the function, the value in MEM1 remains unchanged.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, assume you have a pointer P which stores the address MEM1 (MEM1 stores the value of X). P itself must be stored in an address, say MEM_P1. When P is passed to a function, a new copy of that pointer is created in MEM_P2 (this new copy still stores MEM1) and is passed to the function. Within the function, you can dereference the pointer (access the value in the memory address which is stored in the pointer) and make changes to it. This means that any change is done to the value stored in MEM1, which is the same original memory address storing the value of X. So, when you return from that function, the changes done to the variable stored in MEM1 are retained.</p>"
"2019 Midterm Question 11 Inquiry: <p>Hello,</p>

We must then decrement <code>i</code> to recheck whether or not the value immediately following the removed negative is also negative, since it would be skipped otherwise. </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>1. How does this code exactly work?</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Is it legal to use the same variable name in the loop, since i has already been declared outside the loop and the variable name i has already been used. If we redefining i when initializing the loop, why won&#39;t it cause an error as the code shown below?</p>

<p></p>","I could be wrong here so feel free to edit but your understanding for why the program prints 3 is correct. As for the second question, the answer is yes, but only because the for loop begins a new scope 
<md>The for loop in itself has a scope of it's own. If you declare a variable inside it with the same name as another variable outside the loop, it is acceptable. This is what we referred to as ""overlapping scope."" 

However, if in the same scope you decide to declare a variable with the same name as you are doing in lines 3 and 4 of your screenshot, that is clearly a mistake. This is because you are in the same scope, and you are creating two variables with the same name.

This was clearly explained in lecture 15 at in 28:50 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXoR3H6kUEg</md>

"Memory Question.: What are the main regions of a computer’s memory that we care about in this course? <div>Also, how do they behave as we run a program? </div>","<p>I think we will learn this when we get to dynamic memory allocation, but I believe the main parts are the application memory and specifically the stack and heap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The stack holds local variables and is of fixed size. Each time a new function is called, it along with what it contains in its local scope is placed on the stack. Since the stack is finite, it is possible to run out of space on it through too many function calls or large chunks of memory being allocated, thus we can use the heap which is dynamic (but still finite) and acts sort of like a memory pool. We can allocate and deallocate memory on the heap using malloc and free, and we store pointers to addresses of the heap on the stack. This lets us communicate between the fixed memory we have access to on the stack, and the pool of memory available in the heap. </p>

"Question about alternative code for q.11 2018 midterm: <p>can an instructor confirm if for the question below, the alternative code I&#39;ve used that&#39;s different from the answer key works (is it something that could get full marks, any noticeable loop holes in logic)? I&#39;ve basically used the logic that since the variable maxRange is int, and it is given that we can assume  it is greater than 1, then the smallest value that can be inputted is 2. Using that, I&#39;ve made a separate case for that since the only prime number within the range 1-2 that is a whole number is 2. Otherwise, the code works for every other number as when I input 15, for example, I get 13, and when 14 is input, I get 5. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Write a C program that returns a randomly generated prime number between 1 and a maximum <code>int</code>-type integer, <code>maxRange</code> (inclusive), which is provided by the user as input, and is assumed to be greater than 1. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. For example, 2, 3, 5, 11, and 13 are all prime numbers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The program prompts the user “Enter the maximum range: ” to enter the <code>maxRange</code> value and prints “Random prime number generated is ” followed by the randomly generated prime number. You can assume that the user always enters a positive integer greater than 1. You are not allowed to use arrays or pointer variables in your implementation. For convenience, you do not need to seed the random number generator.</p>

<p>Here is my thought process after the first if-statement: </p>
<pre>
*a = -5, *b = 7, and c = 3
a = b; //a now points to address of b 
*a = *a &#43; 5; //a-&gt;b=7, since a points to b, and b has value 7. We are doing *a = 7&#43;5
//At this time *a = 12, *b = 12, c = 3, since changing *a will change *b since they share pointees</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Then after returning pointer b, a=12 and b=12 c=3. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Slightly confused here! </p>","<p>Since <kbd>a</kbd> is updated to point to the address of <kbd>b</kbd>, the value at <kbd>a</kbd> wouldn&#39;t be changed (<kbd>a</kbd> will still be -5). So the line <kbd>*a = *a &#43; 5</kbd> actually changes the value of <kbd>b</kbd>.</p>

Therefore, the first loop will be:<br />sum = 0 &#43; 0 = 0 right?<br /><br />Then the scanf statement prompts the user to enter the second number which then gets stored in int num. So technically, the code should ignore the first input by the user right because the scanf can&#39;t store two individual input simultaneously? <br />So the final sum should include the sum of all values beginning from the second input until the the negative value.<br />How does it work properly then? Please clarify.",The input value will be parsed when there is a scanf. So the first number will be read into the program after sum=0&#43;0=0. It will not magically just get discarded from the input.

In fact a function can never change the value of the parameter that is passed into the function from the caller scope. What you can do is to pass a pointer and now you can change the content that stores in that address."

"2020 Midterm Q7 Question: <p>Hi, I am confused by the solution for the question itself. How does the k value track the bit it is on? How does the while loop know when to stop?

"Void function return for midterm: <p>For int and double and bool and other function types, I know what we have to use return to indicate what value to return. However, for a void function, I know we can write return; and it would be fine but not writing return is also fine as it&#39;ll automatically return by itself. However, from what i know, not including return is the more &#34;technically right&#34; way, but would we lose marks for writing return; in a void function? It is just a habit I have from working with functions, and technically it wouldn&#39;t affect the code in any way, but I just wanted to make sure it would be fine and we would not lose marks.</p>

"Lab 7 Search Order: <p>Hello,</p>
<p>1) My algorithm doesnt use the given bool function but I have written another function that loops through all the points, checking if they are the current players color and if so running an 8 directional search for a series of opposite player pieces followed by a blank space. That blank space is then guaranteed to be a legal move and so the function records the row &amp; col position in a 2d array to search through later to check for legal moves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doing this works perfectly but I have noticed my outpus are not coming out in the same order as the expected result, currently my algorithms loops through all the points, top-left to bottom-right and checks for all player color points in a counter clockwise rotation starting from south.</p>

"Lab 7  positionInBounds usage clarification: Just a quick question about when to use the positionInBounds function.

"2D array size and declaration: <p>Hi, I was doing lab 7, and I declared the 2D array <em>board</em> like this:</p>
<p><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flm7ukfpyixu1xu%2Fcabffa0c884a0172bdcb2a53d001e50c5be05b32dfb252b053b246c8c341078f%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.png"" /></p>
<p>From my understanding, this 2D array would only have one row with 26 columns, with the first column filled with &#34;\0&#34; and the rest 25 columns automatically filled with &#34;\0&#34; as well. <br />However, I found I can still access &#34;row two&#34; using the expression board[1][0], as seen in the debugger:</p>
<p><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flm7ukfpyixu1xu%2Fa7bffdf29782ab2808914b1d615de40a7a298d98f9fecefe1ac27dac2d890344%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.png"" /></p>
<p>I want to <strong>check</strong> if my understanding is correct:</p>
<p>This is because the 2D array <em>board</em> is essentially a pointer, and the expression board[][] can access addresses that are not part of the 2D array <em>board</em>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, I continued with my declaration of &#34;char board[][26] = {&#39;\0&#39;};&#34;, and my &#34;printBoard&#34; function works. </p>
<p>That means I changed the value in the address board[1][0], which is technically not part of the 2D array <em>board</em>, to &#39;U&#39;. (If the board size is 4*4, then initially, row 2 column 1 would be &#39;U&#39;.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I <strong>wonder</strong> if this declaration is a bad coding style, as I am changing a value in a technically undeclared address and using that undeclared address in future codes. </p>
<p>I also <strong>wonder</strong> if the values stored in these undeclared addresses may change midway during the program runs. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Additionally</strong>, if I declare <em>board</em> like &#34;char board[26][26] = {&#39;\0&#39;};&#34;, can I imagine the computer build a &#34;fence&#34; around all addresses of the 26*26 2D array in the main stack, where the values stored in these addresses can only be changed by the program. Whereas if I declare <em>board</em> like &#34;char board[][26] = {&#39;\0&#39;};&#34;, I am going into &#34;public space&#34; when I am accessing board[1][0], and the addresses in the &#34;public space&#34; can be changed by other operations other than your program, which is unsafe. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Just want to check if my understanding on this is accurate, thank you!</p>
<p></p>","<md>`char board [][26] = {'\0'};` is setting the intention that it is a 1 row with 26 columns 2D array. 

Accessing board[1][1] would be going outside the bounds of the array, and is indeed not correct. The debugger may allow it if the memory space is not used for something else in your computer. If you do so, your program has an undefined behavior. We can't predict what will happen. But this is indeed incorrect. It is not bad coding style. It is incorrect. If it works on your computer, it won't work on ECF. 

You must declare the array as `char board[26][26];` Your program can only access this 2D array, and no other process on your computer should be able to access your array.</md>"

<p></p>
<p>I was just wondering how the teaching team would ensure that students do not simply search online for the &#39;smartest&#39; algorithms and copy? Are there checks for ingenuity? It would be a shame for my small program to be mauled by the most competitive algorithm out there which wasn&#39;t made by a student. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Sorry if my concern is misplaced; again, this is my first programming course. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks</p>","<p>The rules for the leaderboard say that a move should take, at max, 1 second to compute by an algorithm on the ecf server or your lose on a time out (0 Points).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most of these &#39;smart algorithms&#39; online use some sort of tree search algorithm (MCTS for example). These algorithms are &#39;smart&#39; because they can create a tree of possible future positions and search through them to some depth to find the overall most advantageous branch and choose moves as such.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This means even though for example, I&#39;d like to use a tree search to look ahead, the depth at which these trees can look into will be pretty limited because of the time constraint as tree searches indeed have strong performance but not usually very fast calculation times.</p>

<p>Very famous ones are alpha beta pruning with a decision tree. </p>
<p>You can try implementing this and set a time limit for &lt; 1 second.</p>
<p>This is allowed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I took aps105 3 years ago, a lot of tips and tricks were actually to either </p>
<p>1. Search up strategies on how to win reversi</p>
<p>2. Read academic papers on how to win reversi (parameter tuning with alpha beta pruning and what not).</p>
<p></p>
<p>You&#39;ll get in big trouble if you simply copy the &#34;source code&#34; from online. Academic integrity software detectors blah blah will catch that as well as more than likely another student will have done the same. However, you can search up what alpha beta pruning is or a &#34;smart algorithm&#34; for reversi and try and code this up. Or you can do number 1 and code up these strategies. Or you can try coming up with your own heuristics and seeing if it works</p>"

"Lab7 Multiple Iterations: <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I was wondering if we need to take multiple moves from the user or just once? In the example executions in the lab 7 document, it looks like we only display the possible moves once, and take user input for the move once and then display if it&#39;s valid. </p>

"Lab 7, Phantom B&#39;s: <p>Hello, I am currently finishing up on lab7, however when I was submitting my code against the test cases I noticed a strange phenomenon. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I have passed all of the other 3/4 test cases, however when the user enters in a large board size (ex. around anything larger than 21), random B&#39;s start appearing on my board. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, this is what the initial board layout looks like on the ECF servers, before board configuration. </p>
<p><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flm7uk4vzx1rv4%2Fb03d6bff9067383a1efe69157c2b628f48412ff17841578d53e34590d47aee34%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.png"" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Compared to a smaller board size, which works perfectly fine:</p>

<p></p>
<p>What&#39;s even more interesting is that, depending on what device I compile/run it on, I get phantom B&#39;s at different places. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, on my own laptop, I get a lesser amount of Phantom B&#39;s (i.e. just one) and it&#39;s always at the (u,r) coordinate, regardless of the board input size. </p>

There are two games against `aps105-smarter` and two games against `aps105-smartest`.

This is because there is somehow a &#34;\n&#34; queued up as the first input for getChar (From the previous getStringSafely call I imagine) and so it automatically exits the while loop. What is the best way to fix this?",i don’t think you need strings. Just characters with scanf is sufficient

"Lab8part2 MakeMove confusion: <p>Hello, </p>
<p></p>
<p>I am starting lab8 part2 and am a little confused on how to get started. This is my current understanding:</p>
<p>1. While developing the code, your main function calls on the smartMove function and then refers to the makeMove function for the computer to make a move. Therefore, the whole code for lab8part2 includes the main function and the makeMove function. If I want to refer to another function in my main function, like for example, a function called computerMove, computerMove must be located in the makeMove function (per the lab 8 instructions). Therefore, do I have to call makeMove first and then call computerMove in the makeMove function.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It&#39;s sort of difficult to explain, but what am I supposed to have in the main function for part2; just a call on smartMove and makeMove? Should all other function calls I had in part1 be called in the makeMove function (ie. rearrange my whole code to account for this)</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. In the makeMove function, what do row and col stand for and why are they integer pointers? If I call on the makeMove function, am I taking in smartMove&#39;s row and columns as input or does the input mean something else?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Any clarification would be extremely helpful.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>edit: does makeMove only choose a position for the computer to move? The main function /other functions in ECF are therefore only to test our code, so why do all our other functions need to be moved inside makeMove function for submission (will they even be called when being tested)?</strong></p>","<p>makeMove saves the best move. So it saves it inside *row and *col. That&#39;s why they are pointers. It chooses the position for your computer to move.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You need your other functions inside makeMove to presumably help you find out what the best move is</p>"
"MakeMove Function Clarification: Once we implement the makeMove function, should the makeMove function also flip the tiles? Or only set the row and col pointers to the best position for our ai?",no. Just set the row and col pointers to the best position

"Segfault After Player Has No Valid Move - Lab8Part2: <p>I am unsure if anyone can help me on this or if anyone has had similar problems, however I thought it was worth asking. </p>

<p>When I run my program everything runs smoothly except for whenever the human player has no valid move and the computer has to repeat a move. Then for some reason it just runs into a segfault. This does not occur whenever the computer runs out of moves and the human player has to input it again. </p>

Are you using any common variables between the player move and when you actually execute moves onto the board?

If you are continually adding without setting back to 0 and you try to access an array at this unexpectedly large index, it may cause a segfault error."

<p>If my Lab 8 Part 2 program wins once against Smarter but twice against Smartest, how many marks would I get?</p>

<p>Edit: Found the original post in the Followup Discussions section under @953 (shown below). However, would the program still be eligible for the leaderboard, or would the program have to pass both Smarter test cases first?<br /><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flm7uk2nchjopf%2Ff6774753a6946e2ffd5a6ce252df4fbe5bee566bae10c1575a845497be9ac1d6%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.png"" width=""401"" height=""248"" /></p>",for every win it’s 2 marks  no matter if it’s smartest or smarter

Please make sure you have no infinite loops and you&#39;re closing your remote connection to ECF when you are done.

<p>However, whenever I run the test cases on the ECF it fails to pass any test cases. Could this be due to time complications? Or is there anything else I forgot to consider. </p>

If not, please do and use the debugger there. There is a chance that you&#39;re having an uninitialized variable or you&#39;re accessing elements outside the bounds of an array. "
