Question,Answer
What is Oddysey and how do I access it?: The course outline says that you should go to the location specified on Oddysey instead of Quest when going for your tutorial discussions. How do I access Oddysey? Is there a link somewhere that I&#39;m not seeing?,"<p>I think you want to go to this link: <a href=""https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Currently, I can see Quiz 1 and 2 but there is no location or seating yet. I believe they will add these soon.</p>
<p>Yes, the student answer is correct. </p>
<p>Odyssey is where you will find your assigned seat for each quiz (your seat will vary from quiz to quiz). Note, however, that for tonight&#39;s tutorial, you should arrive to your assigned room on Quest. There will be an email sent with more details later today.</p>"

<p>The best way to approach such a question is by analyzing the cases of the variables. For this question there are 4 such cases.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Case 1:</strong> $$a \geq 0$$ and $$b \geq 0$$ <br /></p>
<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> $$a \leq 0$$ and $$b \leq 0$$</p>
<p><strong>Case 3:</strong> $$a \geq 0$$ and $$b \leq 0$$</p>
<p><strong>Case 4:</strong> $$a \leq 0$$ and $$b \geq 0$$</p>

"Who should I contact if I would arrive late for the quiz and what should I do?: <p>The quiz should be on the tutorial class every Wednesday starting at 6:30 PM. However, I had my EMLS129R-003 class which was located in Renison from 4:30PM to 6:20PM. Although the google says this is an 8-minute walk from Renison to M3 or somewhere near M3 and MC building inside the main campus, considering the possible delay and all kinds of things to do during the transition like packing up, waiting for elevator, climbing up and down, finding the new classroom in the not-so-familiar building, etc., it seemed impossible for me to arrive on time. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Who should I contact it for? And what probably would be a solution for it? From my observation, there is at least one more student in EMLS129R-003 who also took Math137 and would need to travel to the main campus for quiz. So it should be a quite common situation not just for me but for many students. </p>

"Triangle Inequality Proof Question: <p>Hello, I have a question about the approach we used to prove the Triangle Inequality in 1 dimension on the first day of class. In our proof, for a 1d triangle abc, we assumed a &lt; b, then did 3 cases, each assuming c to be in a different interval (either c &lt; a &lt; b or a &lt; c &lt; b or a &lt; b &lt; c), then demonstrating the inequality for |a-b| $$\leq$$ |c-b| &#43; |a-c| is true in each case. Would it also be valid a method for proving to assume the 1d  triangle abc has a &lt; b &lt; c, then demonstrating</p>
<p>|a-b| $$\leq$$ |a-c| &#43; |b-c|,</p>
<p>|a-c| $$\leq$$ |a-b| &#43; |b-c|,</p>
<p>and |b-c| $$\leq$$ |a-b| &#43; |a-c|?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Would this be a valid method for proving the triangle inequality?</p>","I&#39;m not quite sure if I understand the question, but once we&#39;ve proven the triangle inequality then we can replace the variables in the expression to derive any other equivalent expression. The three equations you&#39;ve written look like the original $$|x-z| \leq |x-y| + |y-z|$$ but with the variables $$x,y,z$$ replaced with different combinations of $$a,b,c$$."

"Practice Problem Q2 a): <p>To prove |a| - |b| = |a&#43;b|, is it necessary to include the proof for the triangle inequality as well? Or can I just assume it&#39;s true and use it?</p>
<p></p>","<p>You don&#39;t need to include the proof. We assume you know triangular inequality and its proof.</p>
<p><br />When you answer the question on the quiz, you just need to write &#34;(by triangular inequality)&#34; beside the part where you used the theorem (VERY IMPORTANT NOTE AS THIS WILL SAVE YOU BUNCH OF TIME). You can check the practice solution as an example.<br /><br />Unless the question specifically mentioned &#34;Prove this theorem&#34;, you don&#39;t need to prove the <strong>theorem</strong> taught during the class.

"Question Regarding James Stewart Textbook: <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was recommended to purchase a James Stewart calculus book for practice, and I found this one at a used book store.

<p></p>
I have that book. The difference is that the early transcendentals version has more problems with transcendental functions earlier on in the book. This Stewart &#34;Calculus&#34; textbook should have everything from single variable to multi variable. The Stewart &#34;Calculus: Single Variable Calculus&#34; and Stewart &#34;Calulus: Multivariable Calculus&#34; are just 2 smaller books containing chapters 1-10 and 11-17 directly from the full Stewart &#34;Calculus&#34;."
"Question about the triangle inequality: In the triangle inequality, I&#39;m slightly confused as to why it is assumed that x &lt; y. Why is this assumption needed for the proof to be valid? Would appreciate an explanation. Thanks!","<p>If x=y then |x-y|=0. Since we are trying to prove that |x-y| is smaller or equal to |y-z| &#43; |z-y|, 0 is smaller or equal than any |y-z| &#43; |z-y| (i.e. the right side of the inequality cannot be negative). This means we do not have to worry about x=y.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, since |x-y| = |y-x|, they are kind of interchangeable (meaning if you cover x&lt;y, you also cover x&gt;y).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus, we can continue the proof assuming x&lt;y without loss of generality.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that by assuming x&lt;y, we aren&#39;t making the proof valid, but rather, we are noting that we already are covering the other scenarios (x=y or x&gt;y).</p>
<p>If x=y then |x-y|=0. Since we are trying to prove that |x-y| is smaller or equal to |y-z| &#43; |z-y|, 0 is smaller or equal than any |y-z| &#43; |z-y| (i.e. the right side of the inequality cannot be negative). This means we do not have to worry about x=y.</p>

"Week 1 Practice Quiz: A Single Interval: <p>Hello!</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the questions in the Week 1 Practice Quiz asks us whether an inequality can be expressed as a single open interval (I&#39;ve attached the Mobius solution below for context).</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flkqwcm6iy84zh%2F76793789f588678d249154cf2741c70a969203d063c60308a5c9bfe1f451d527%2FScreenshot_2023-09-10_122759.png"" width=""1088"" height=""496"" alt="""" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I wanted to ask for clarification on two aspects of the solution: First, why do we claim that for a single open interval to exist, $$(-b + 2, b+2)$$ must intersect with exactly one of the previous 2 intervals? Does $$(-b + 2, b+2)$$ ranging from the middle of the first to the middle of the second interval not leave us with a single open interval?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m also wondering how we determine the 2 cases at the bottom. When I drew out a mock-number line, I initially thought that $$ -b+2 < -a+2$$ in case 1, and $$a+2 < b+2$$ in case 2 for &#34;overlap&#34; to occur. I&#39;m not quite sure I&#39;m seeing why both cases use the opposite inequalities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>","To answer your question, <br />1, if (-b&#43;2, b&#43;2) intersect both, you will have two disconnected interval. That is due to the previous 2 intervals are not connected, thus the intersection of (-b&#43;2, b&#43;2) and those previous two intervals will also be disconnected.<br />2, The reason those two cases are opposite inequalities in the feedback, is because the cases they put are when intersection of those two sets are empty set. So in this case, we do not want overlap to occur."

That is because the distance from a is 0. Remember, absolute value |x-a| is the distance from x to a. If x=a  then the distance is 0. Therefore, in order for 0 &lt; |x-a| &lt; $$\delta$$ to be true, you have to exclude a. Hope this helps!"

<p>Remember that once you find a cutoff that works then any other cutoff AFTER that is also valid.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Small detail here is that the choice $$N = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\epsilon} - 1}$$ restricts $$\epsilon$$ to being 1 or smaller when technically it should be allowed to be any number. The &#34;fix&#34; for that is to realize that if $$\epsilon$$ is bigger than 1 then because the sequence is given by $$\frac{1}{n^2 + 1}$$ and $$n \geq 1$$ the distance from $$\frac{1}{n^2 + 1}$$ to $$0$$ is already smaller than $$1$$ for all $$n$$.</p>"

The basic idea of students&#39; answer is correct. You separate ||x| − |y|| into two cases: |x| − |y| &gt;= 0 and |x| − |y| &lt; 0. Then acquire |x-y| = |y-x| then the rest of the proof is basically equivalent to practice problem 2a).<br /> <br />However, there are some issues, as |x| - |y| <strong>DOES NOT EQUAL TO </strong>|x-y|. same for |y-x| case.

"clarification of interval notation: <p>just wondering if there r 2 intervals for which a variable x belongs to, would u need to express ur answer in a way that puts the leftmost interval on the left and rightmost on the right? or does it not matter? </p>

<p>2) a &lt; |x - 6|</p>

<p>Given that we are we are restricting the distance between &#34;x&#34; and &#34;6&#34; to <strong>MORE </strong>than &#34;a&#34; units, we are left with an infinite amount of values which satisfy this inequality.</p>

<p></p>
<p>You are asked to find all values that are less than 5.</p>

<p>We can choose any epsilon or do anything to epsilon as long as it is &gt;0. We can say 0.0000001$$\epsilon$$. As long as it is not negative. In this case, $$\sqrt L$$ was chosen since in the end, you would need the inequality to be equal to epsilon. </p>

<p>Hi, I am wondering about why the √an on the denominator disappear. Thank you for your time!</p>","the denominator disappears because $$\frac{|a_n-L|}{\sqrt{a_n}+\sqrt{L}} <\frac{|a_n-L|}{\sqrt{L}}$$ This is because the question states that $$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, (a_n>0) \implies \sqrt{a_n}>0$$, meaning that $$\sqrt{a_n}+\sqrt{L}>\sqrt{L}$$ for the denominators. If you are dividing a number by a bigger number, you will have a smaller number in the end (ex. 5/3 &gt; 5/4). $$\sqrt{a_n}+\sqrt{L}$$ is bigger than $$\sqrt{L}$$, leading to the conclusion that $$\frac{|a_n-L|}{\sqrt{a_n}+\sqrt{L}} <\frac{|a_n-L|}{\sqrt{L}}$$."

definition about an: When can we assume {an} is a sequence of natural numbers? if not why does the definition of limit indicate that N belongs to natural numbers?,"the definition of the limit says that $$N \in \mathbb{N}$$ because N represents a term of the sequence. for example, if i had the sequence $$\{ 2,4,6,8,...\}$$ then 2 would be the first term, 4 would be the second term, and so on. It doesn&#39;t make sense to have a term that is not a natural number. For example, there is no -2 term of a sequence or no 0.2 term of a sequence. Since N represents a <strong>term of the sequence</strong>, it must be a natural number. Whether or not $$\{ a_n\}$$ is a sequence of natural numbers depends on the function that defines the sequence. if $$a_n=n$$, the sequence will just be 1,2,3,4,... and the sequence will consist of only natural numbers ($$f:n\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$$). if $$a_n=\frac{1}{n}$$, the sequence will be $$1, 1/2, 1/3, ...$$ and will not just consist of natural numbers ($$f:n\rightarrow \mathbb {R}$$)."

<p>How are we supposed to solve this question? Isolating n takes a long time, and so does substituting the answers into the equation. What is the intended solution?</p>","<p>@187 @159</p>
<p></p>
<p>Basically, you&#39;re supposed to solve it like a quadratic. You end up getting a quadratic like &#34;εn² &#43; (ε-2)n - 1 &gt; 0&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that, if you imagine a parabola in your head, there are two areas where εn² &#43; (ε-2)n - 1 &gt; 0 (we will deal with this later).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Plug into the quadratic formula.</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\frac{\sqrt{\epsilon^2+4)}-\epsilon + 2}{2\epsilon}$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that we get two solutions, the positive square root, and the negative square root. The negative square root is extraneous (we know that the negative solution is less than 0 using the geometric fact that the hypotenuse is the longest side of a triangle i.e. $$\sqrt{\epsilon^2+2^2} > 2$$ so $$\sqrt{\epsilon^2+2^2} > 2-\epsilon$$, and $$n \geq 1$$ so negative solution is not possible).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then you can basically just cross out incorrect answers (need answers of N that are greater than $$\frac{\sqrt{\epsilon^2+4)}-\epsilon + 2}{2\epsilon}$$).</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a bit of a longer question so don&#39;t worry too much if it takes a while.</p>

"Proving a sequence is increasing and bounded above at the same time: <p>Hello,</p>

<p>Pf:</p>
<p>We know $$|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$$ when $$0<|x-a|<\delta$$ for all $$\epsilon>0$$. Assume $$L<0$$. When $$f(x)>0$$, $$f(x)-L>0$$ so we can drop the absolute values to get $$f(x)-L<\epsilon$$.

<p>for this solution, how did we just assume the limit is 8? Shouldn&#39;t it be 10^7 cause that&#39;s what the value of the function is at that time? And if we did just randomly assume 8 could we have assumed something else?</p>","I think because finding the limit at a certain point means to find the behaviour of a function around that point (not necessarily at the point itself). So, following that, we use the first part of the piecewise function and sub in x = 1 to get 8. Correct me if I’m wrong…
You can think limit at a certain point as, you are approaching to that point but you will never reach it. o.o"

<p>I am not sure why 0 is the upper bound.

"Strategy for evaluating limits at -infinity for functions: <p>Hello,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am a bit confused on how to evaluate limits at -∞, usually when finding horizontal asymptotes. I get that we have strategies for &#43;∞, such as dividing by x to the highest power, but I don&#39;t know any for -∞.</p>
<p></p>

<p>I would appreciate it if I could get some help on how to tackle these kinds of questions.</p>

So, if $$\delta = \frac{1}{N}$$ and $$x < \delta$$, then $$x < \frac{1}{N}$$. This means $$\frac{1}{x} > N$$, so $$\frac{1}{x}$$ is greater than the cutoff, thus the limit converges. </p>

"Newtons method limitations: <p>Hello,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was reading through some course notes and found that newton&#39;s method can sometimes not work because if you pick a point too far from the root, the sequence may diverge.</p>
<p>Could someone please explain this further as it was kind of confusing to me where the term sequence came from when we are talking about functions.</p>

<p>I might be wrong but i think an example of it failing would be  : <br />For $$f(x) = \sqrt[3] x$$<br />We can define a recursive sequence : <br />$$-2x_{n}$$<br />Here f(x) crosses the x-axis at x=0. If we use the recursive sequence for an x thats too far away, say x=2, we get x=-4.

"Long Answer Questions on Quizzes: Hi, this is a general question, but I am wondering on quizzes, if we get the correct answer on the long answer questions but our work is not correct, or we used a different method than we were meant to would we still get full marks, considering we found the correct answer? Or will we get marks taken off if some of our work is incorrect. Thanks.","Generally yes, as long as the different method is valid. If the method is invalid, then it is <em>possible </em>there may be a part-mark for a correct final answer (but this is not always the case). <br /><br />For example, on one of the previous quizzes, there was a question of the form $$\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0} x^2 \sin(\frac{1}{x})$$ and many students used the limit rules to show the limit to be 0. However, the limit rules cannot be applied since the limit of $$\sin(\frac{1}{x})$$ DNE and hence one needs to use the squeeze theorem. So applying the limit rules would not result in full points."
"linear function definition: In Math137, is a constant function considered a linear function?","<p>A polynomial is of the form $$p(x) = c_n x^n + c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + c_1 x + c_0$$ where $$c_i \in \mathbb{R}$$. Because of this, we can pick $$c_i = 0$$ except $$c_0$$ so a constant function would be a polynomial. </p>

<p></p>
<p>By the way, does both function need to be continuous for this operation, or only the outer function is continuous (ln) will be sufficient for this operation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>thank you</p>","<p>I&#39;m certainly not up to the challenge of proving this for you, but I can offer some insights as to why it&#39;s true. In the Course Notes, [Thm 11: Sequential Characterization of Limits] and [Thm 15: Continuity of compositions] show that the limit of a sequence that approaches $$\infty$$ and is equal to $$a$$ is also equal to $$f(a)$$. You can also look at the proof of Thm 15 in lecture slides (One example is Lec 14 006_Kotecha (Continuity), which you can find under instructor content).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In terms of your second question, I think only the outer one needs to be continuous, then you can examine the inner limit and see whether it exists or not. In this case, the inner function would be discontinuous at $$x=-7$$ but I&#39;m not sure if that matters since we want $$x\to\infty$$. The inner function might need to be continuous for $$x$$ near to $$a$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Would appreciate an instructor&#39;s insights on this question as well.</p>
The student answer is correct. <br /><br />For a composition of functions, $$h(x) = g(f(x))$$, you need $$f$$ to be continuous at $$a$$ and $$g$$ to be continuous $$f(a)$$ and then you can conclude that $$h(x)$$ is also continuous at $$x=a$$."

"Quiz 9 Version A SA 1: How does this answer work for a = 0, b = 0?: <p>Hello,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I understand applying LHR to $$\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^a-1}{x^b-1}$$ will give $$\frac{a}{b}$$, but how does this work if $$a = 0$$ and $$b = 0$$ (since $$a,b\in\mathbb{R}$$)? In this case, the limit would evaluate to 1, but $$\frac{a}{b}$$ is 0/0. Furthermore, even by applying LHR to $$\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^0-1}{x^0-1}$$ multiple times will never result in the answer 1, but always result in $$\frac{0}{0}$$. Thus, LHR would not even apply since the derivative of the denominator is always 0. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I was confused by this during the quiz, so I&#39;m not sure how $$\frac{a}{b}$$ addresses the case when $$a = 0, b = 0$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would appreciate some clarification on this.</p>","Ahh, that&#39;s a good point. In the case where $$b=0$$, we actually have DNE as an answer since $$\frac{x^a-1}{0}$$ is undefined for all $$x\in\mathbb{R}$$.

<p>I am still struggling to understand whether or not I am allowed to put the highlighted &#34;$$<\epsilon$$&#34; in that step without ruining the proof. I do not want to incorrectly assume the conclusion in the first step of my proof but it still looks like if I were to plug $$\frac{3\epsilon +2}{9\epsilon }$$ into N for $$|\frac{2N}{3N-1}-\frac{2}{3}|$$, it would still evaluate to $$\epsilon$$ just as it does with $$\frac{2}{9N-3}$$ as in the official solution, so I don&#39;t understand how it could be a false statement to say $$|\frac{2N}{3N-1}-\frac{2}{3}|<\epsilon$$?</p>
<p></p>
<p>TLDR does the highlighted &#34;$$<\epsilon$$&#34; break my proof?</p>","<p>I would say yes, that is an issue because you are assuming the conclusion at the beginning of your proof. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Basically, you shouldn&#39;t assume that $$|a_n - L |< \epsilon$$ at the beginning. Instead, you should derive this relationship in your calculation and your choice for $$N$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In the posted solution, notice that we start with $$|a_n - L|$$ and do a series of simplifications to get to $$|a_n - L| = \frac{2}{9n-3}$$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, since $$n \geq N$$, we have $$\frac{2}{9n-3} \leq \frac{2}{9N-3}$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, since we picked $$N>\frac{1}{9} (\frac{2}{\epsilon} + 3)$$, this means $$\frac{2}{9N-3} < \epsilon$$ (after simplification). <br /><br />The main point is that the logical structure of the proof is important. You start with $$|a_n-L|$$ and then show that your choice of $$N$$ leads to a $$<\epsilon$$ at the end.</p>"

"Practice quiz q2: Can points of inflection be non-critical points: <p>Is it true that some points of inflection can be at non-critical points?</p>
<p></p>
<p>For instance -- I know that the local extrema in this graph are critical points, but is it fair to say that there is an inflection point some where between (-1, 0) and (0, 1), since it seems like there must be a point in these intervals where the concavity has changed?</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the graph from practice quiz MC question 2:</p>
<p><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flkqwdh2s3927me%2Fd2e586973667cbc132bfcc855b258ade59ed8f4242a51d105b3f6660c2cf2238%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.png"" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering this because the answer to the question related to this graph seems to imply that there is a constant concavity between (-1, 0) and (0, 1), when I think that there should be a point where the concavity changes?</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src=""/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Flkqwdh2s3927me%2F772458963aa7d2dc3717c142f7998ed402823c9da0d063190e6b3d4987544027%2Fimage.png"" alt=""image.png"" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>So a couple of questions:</p>
<p>1. Can inflection points be non-critical points</p>
<p>2. Is there an inflection point at (-1, 0) and (0, 1)</p>
<p>3. If so, wouldn&#39;t this mean that the explanation is partially incorrect, since we can&#39;t conclude that there is a constant direction in concavity between the intervals?</p>","<p>First, I want to mention that you might be misinterpreting this question. It says this is a graph of the <strong>first derivative, </strong>not of the function itself. I got confused when first looking at that question and I always make the mistake of treating it as the function instead of the derivative. </p>
<p></p>
<p>That in mind, to answer your questions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Yes, poi don&#39;t have to be critical points. POI are where the second derivative is 0 or DNE, CP&#39;s are where the first derivative is 0 or DNE. A POI doesn&#39;t imply a critical point. You can see an example of this in Lec 31 006_Kotecha (Curve Sketching) notes on Learn (at the point (-1, 0) on the final sketch). Let me know if you need help finding it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. No, since this is a graph of the first derivative, we can see that it is increasing on (-1, 0), thus f&#34;(x) &gt;0 on this interval. Similarly, the graph is decreasing on (0, 1) so f&#34;(x)&lt;0 on this interval. There is no poi on these intervals. (although I think the local extrema of this graph would be poi since f&#34;(x)=0 there)</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Again, you would be correct if this were the function itself, but since this is the first derivative we have to treat it differently. I think the concavity of this graph would be the third derivative but I&#39;m not sure. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Hope that helps, happy to clarify further! </p>
<p>The student answer is correct, however, I would like to clarify one thing: points where $$f''(c) =0$$ or $$f''(c)$$ DNE are not necessarily inflection points, they are <strong>candidate </strong>inflection points. (Analogously, points where $$f'(c) = 0$$ and $$f'(c)$$ DNE are not necessarily local extrema, they are <strong>candidate</strong> local extrema.) <br /><br /></p>
<p>An inflection point at $$x=c$$ requires that concavity change sign around $$c$$ and that $$f(x)$$ is continuous at $$c$$.</p>"
"Practice Quiz Question 4: Where does (x-a)! come from: <p>I understand that $$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}(x-a)+f(a)$$ is the secant line that forms between a and b, but where does $$(x-a)!$$ come from?</p>

<p>I have been working on the 2022 final exam practice and am completely confused by Q6.</p>
<p>What worries me most is that I can&#39;t think of any way to connect this problem to the course material.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We assume that f&#39;(x) is increasing, but we can&#39;t assume f is twice differentiable so it feels like a useless hint (since no conclusions about concavity can be made).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The idea of the tangents intersecting seems like it comes out of no where and I can&#39;t think of any theorems we learned that deal with things like this.<br /><br /></p>
<p>I would like to ask for help on this question as well as some overall tips on how to approach proofs on the exam. I assume they will be similar to this one in the sense that they will be unlike anything we have seen before. I know part of the proof is being able to think of a solution on the spot but in scenarios like these I would pretty much use up all my time on this question and still not get an answer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have similar concerns about Q7 as well :(</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you</p>","<p>Well, I would always start by listing out (on paper or mentally) the information we have and see where we can go from there. So in this case, we have $$f(x)$$ is differentiable on $$\mathbb{R} \implies f(x)$$ is cts on $$\mathbb{R}$$. We also have the fact that $$f'(x)$$ is increasing (not assuming that the function is twice differentiable), which means that for any $$x_1 < x_2$$, we have $$f'(x_1) < f'(x_2)$$, or in other words, no two tangent lines have the same slope.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Now, let&#39;s consider any $$a \in\mathbb{R}$$ and the tangent line at $$x = a$$, we have $$y = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$$. For these types of questions, proof by contradiction will probably work out. So let&#39;s assume for contradiction that the tangent line intersects $$f(x)$$ for some $$b \in\mathbb{R}, b\neq a$$, which means that $$f(b) = f(a) + f'(a)(b-a)$$. Since $$f(x)$$ is cts for all $$\mathbb{R}$$, we can use MVT, which gives us $$\exists c \in (a,b)$$ (or $$(b,a)$$), such that $$f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = f'(a)$$.

<p>The student answer is correct. I&#39;ll also add that when you&#39;re giving an abstract problem like this, it is useful to also think about what major theorems are applicable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this problem, $$f$$ is differentiable everywhere, so we can certainly apply the MVT, IVT, and EVT. The MVT has a $$f'$$ in it and this problem gives me information related to $$f'$$ whereas IVT, EVT don&#39;t talk at all about $$f'$$. So at first glance, it feels like MVT may be useful here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A slightly different approach would be the following: the tangent line at $$x=a$$ is given by $$L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$$. Then, we&#39;re asked to show that $$L(x) = f(x)$$ at exactly one point (it&#39;s clear that $$L(a) = f(a)$$). We can also re-frame the problem and define $$h(x) = L(x) - f(x)$$ and now we&#39;re asked to show that a function has exactly 1 root. Can you think about how we can do that?</p>

<p>Since Taylor&#39;s equality gives $$|f(x) - T_{n,0}(x)| \leq \frac{M}{(n+1)!} |x|^{n+1}$$. As you pointed, we know that $$M \leq 1$$ and since $$1\leq2$$ so we have</p>

You won&#39;t need to classify any discontinuities. However, if a limit DNE (e.g $$\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{|x|}{x}$$ you would need to state DNE) or if a limit is $$\pm \infty$$, you&#39;d need to state that as well, e.g $$\lim_{x\to0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty$$.

<p>(b) doesn&#39;t say anything about whether $$f'(x) > 0$$, only that it is <strong>increasing </strong>on $$\mathbb{R}$$. We know that $$f'(x)$$ is increasing since $$f''(x) > 0$$.</p>

You will not lose any mark for a <em>fully justified</em> argument that is correct.  You should be fine if you verify that $$|x+3|<99999$$ when $$2<x<4$$, i.e., if you state somewhere that $$5<x+3<7$$ so $$|x+3|<7<99999$$.  As a general rule, you should demonstrate that you understand the behaviour of these functions, not just use some large number like 99999 without giving any reasoning."

<p>This does not apply since we won&#39;t be able to find what $$f''(c)$$ is. </p>

<p>This does not apply, since for this theorem we assume $$f'(x) = 0$$ and that $$f''(x)$$ is continuous at $$x=c$$, neither of which are true for the scenario you are describing. You would not be able to evaluate the second derivative at a point where $$f'(x)$$ is discontinuous. </p>

"When Newton&#39;s method DOES work: We spoke a lot about how newtons method can fail (first guess makes derivative 0, oscillating sequence), but what are the set of conditions such that it DOES work?","<p>That&#39;s beyond the scope of the course, so I don&#39;t think we&#39;d ask you something like that. A standard Newton&#39;s Method question could be something like, here&#39;s a function $$f(x)$$, calculate 2-3 iterations etc.</p>

"Taylor polynomials general Q: if our approximating for taylor polynomials is an underestimate, would the new interval would be [Tn,a (x)-error, Tn,a (x)] ","<p>I think it would be the other way around.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For an underestimate, our taylor polynomial is less than the actual value, so our interval would be $$f(x) \in [T_{n, a}(x),\;\; T_{n, a}(x) +error]$$. Because at the very least, our estimate would be spot on (left side of interval), but likely we are underestimating so it could be anything within our taylor polynomial &#43; error. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For overestimate, we would have $$f(x) \in [T_{n, a}(x)-error,\;\; T_{n, a}(x)]$$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TeChnicaLLy, if the question doesn&#39;t specify the smallest possible interval, and you are unsure whether to add the error or subtract, you can just say $$f(x) \in [T_{n, a}(x)-error,\;\; T_{n, a}(x) + error]$$. Although tactics like this are generally discouraged (but still valid with justification! ;D )</p>"
"Forgot to fill out back sheet on the final: <p>During the test, I filled out the multiple choice and true / false by circling on the questions, planning to fill in the back sheet at the end. But I forgot to fill it out, and my back sheet is completely blank.</p>

Lost NeckWarmer at PAC?: I think I lost a blue NeckWarmer at PAC? Does anyone know if it’s possible for me to retrieve it?,You can try to ask the people at the desk. I do know that there is a lost and found at the PAC.
Progression Question: I know progression is 60% so what happens if I am below this number for final mark? Do I fail the course and have to redo? Do I have to drop out of my program?,"you might want to contact your academic advisor
<p>If you score below 50% that is a fail.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you score between 50 and 60% then you have passed the course, however, you cannot take MATH 138. You can take other courses that don&#39;t require a prerequisite 60% in MATH 137 (eg MATH 128). Whether you can take 128 instead of 138 depends on your program. <br /><br />You should speak with an academic advisor to discuss your particular situation.</p>"
